okay so uh today we we are looking at three major events in American history uh the moon landing the assassination of JFK and 911 now as you may know the official story is something that a lot of people do not accept okay so we're going to look at the official story and then we'll see some of the issues with the um official story so first I want to show you some videos first we're going to watch the moon landing so 1969 July 20th they shoot three men into space uh Boss Uldren Michael Collins Neil Armstrong neil Armstrong becomes the first man in the world to walk on the moon okay and this is his journey all right so let's watch it together what you will see is that it takes a lot of thrust to get the man into space 30 ft down 2 and 1/2 picking up some dust 30 ft two and a half down break that out four forward forward drifting to the right level this is considered the greatest achievement in human history it took years and years of hard work involving 400,000 people are working for NASA to accomplish this perfect landing on the moon we're breathing again thanks a lot okay Neil we can see you coming down the ladder now i'm at the foot of the ladder the lamb footeds are only uh What is amazing is that this is being broadcast live from the moon back to NASA so their technology back then is far superior to to our technology today small step for man one leap for mankind this is so great you can't believe it oh I believe it charlie get ready john look at it would you got all your steering and get straight oh this is going to be some kind of different ride hippity hippity hippity up and over hill i know this looks fake but it's not okay this is official NASA footage live from the moon and this is the best part okay the best part is when they return from the moon back to Earth you see how easy it is it's just like they just fly up no resistance at all okay perfect humanity's greatest achievement now what's amazing is that while they were on the moon both of you President Nixon and the astronauts had a phone conversation okay yeah I think something rather important is coming up here uh Neil and Buzz this is being broadcast broadcast live to American people okay would like to say a few words to Hello Neil and Buzz i'm talking to him by telephone from the old and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House i just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done for every American this has to be the proudest day of our lives and for people all over the world I am sure that they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of man's world okay the heavens have become part of man's world right remember how last class we talked about how they wanted to bring the heavens down to earth okay this is idea of inversion okay but do you see how amazing it is that they were able to have this seamless phone conversation okay okay now they go to the moon and you would think that they would come back and they're heroes right imagine if the school took you all on a trip to Mount Everest you spent six months climbing the world's tallest mountain you come back and you feel amazing right you feel on top of the world you're ecstatic you want the whole world to know about it well they should be feeling the same thing right okay here's a press conference after the uh Sorry i have two brief questions I'd like to ask if I may when you were carrying out that incredible moon walk did you find that the surface was equally firm anywhere or were there harder and softer spots that you could detect and secondly when you looked up at the sky could you actually see the stars and the solar corona in spite of the glare we were never able to see stars from the lunar surface or on the daylight side of the moon by eye without looking through the optics uh I don't recall during the period of time that we were photographing the sonar what what stars we could see i don't remember seeing any i don't remember seeing any stars he doesn't remember anything okay did you see how nervous they are it's very strange all right and that's why even today there are a lot of people who do not believe the moon landing happened okay so we'll go over the theories as to why later on but but now let's switch focus and let's look at 911 all right so this is the buildings coming down on 911 watch how watch how they come down it's very strange the North Tower came crashing down a rumble so this is strange because a plane hit that building right now it's on fire it's very strange that the building could come straight down like that it's almost like a demolition i'm not saying it's a demolition but it looks kind of strange okay what's even stranger is that there were two planes that hit the twin towers that day but there were three buildings which came down the north tower the south tower and building number seven which was across the street nothing hit that thing it came down okay so let's watch the video it's on fire okay but but whoa it's kind of strange comes straight down nothing hit that nothing a plane did not hit this thing okay and then of course there's another video that's kind of strange which is the president of the United States George W bush during the attacks he's president of the United States he's sitting in a classroom watching a teacher teach that's kind of strange guys he's kind of busy right he spend the entire morning while the attacks are happening just watching the class being taught his positioning is weird because if you're if you are a president you should be behind this is his assistant telling him there's an attack why is he being rushed out of that bu that room and being put in a safe place right okay he's just he's just sitting there america's being attacked and he's just sitting around with kids mr president York thank you all step out okay so a reporter is asking him "Mr president do you know that America's being attacked right now and he's like we'll talk about it later he's not worried he No at this point no one knows who's attacking America no one knows how large the attack is as president of United States he should be rushed immediately to a safe location and he's not worried he's like "We'll talk about later." very very strange okay and that's why even today people are suspicious about what happened okay guys so having seen the videos let's go over what happened okay okay so um let's talk about the JFK assassination on November 22nd 1963 JFK was assassinated and Lyndon B johnson new president he organizes a commission called the Warren Commission to investigate what happened and they produced this huge huge report thousand of pages and the report says that only one person was involved Lee Harvey Oswald and he was able to kill the president of United States because of his common sympathies and that's it okay there are certain problems though okay so this is the president of United States and he's in Dallas touring um uh Dallas i want to point something strange about this picture okay you see how in the front JFK is in the front but all the security is behind him that makes no sense what's the point of security if the security is all behind him right because if someone rushes and attacks him they're too far behind right also you see how the sold the the the the bodyguards and the police officers are to the side well that's to prevent snipers right so my question then is why is this car behind structuring a way to protect the people inside but the carrying JFK it doesn't have any bodyguards that's kind of strange all right um this is the location the map of the motorcade so JFK he's streaming down and then he when he gets into the spot Leo Hareld is able to take three shots at him and kill and kill him at the spot so so Leo Oswald takes three shots and kills JFK but as you can see the problem with location is there actually lots of places where you can take a shot at the president because he's in an open car with no security and there were a lot of witnesses who believe that there were other shooters as well at least one more shooter and they heard the shot from other places many of these witnesses almost 30 of them were all killed or died they die mysteriously soon afterwards that's very strange um this is the manora okay which is a uh holy candle in the Judeaic tradition you you see how the shape is very similar to this plaza called the Alia Plaza what's also interesting about the Ala Plaza is it was a site of the first Freemason large temple in Texas okay so there's there are these religious significance to this place it was almost like they picked this place for a ritual sacrifice okay so we'll talk about the Freemasons later on because they're very important the Freemasons are the ones who uh some say control America okay um Leo Harold fired three bullets and there's one bullet which hit JFK but it's called a magic bullet because it was also able to ricochet off JFK and hit Governor Connelly who was also sitting in the car as well okay so they insisted that there was only one shooter he fired three shots and one bullet was able to injure everyone because the bullet was a magic bullet that was in the official Warren Commission okay so Leo Harvey Osweld he's he's been arrested and he's been charged with killing the president this is Leo Harvey Osweld when he's going to court he is ambushed by a man named Jack Rubin do you see how close shot gets and shoots Leha Roswell point blank okay now this is a strange picture because first of all how did Leo sorry how did Jack Ruby get so close there was no security second of all you see how Leo Harold he's being held in held in place by two police officers who are much bigger than him right so it's very hard for Osworld to dodge the bullet okay that's number two number three is do you see his reaction he is a trained police officer and he looks scared he looks confused if you are a police officer and someone comes at you menacing right you know to push him away or draw your gun but you see how he just freezes that goes against his training that's very strange okay I'm not saying that this is a conspiracy but I'm just saying how this doesn't really add up there are lots of questions that are raised by this also um JFK has a brother Robert F kennedy and in 1968 Robert F kennedy runs for president and it seems as though he's about to win the Democratic nomination and then he gets killed too and again the question is how did this happen and it's a mystery how this man named Sirhan Sirhan and he does not look like a killer okay lehar Rosa does not look like a killer he does not look like a killer either okay but they charge him with a crime and he's still in prison even today he's saying "I didn't do it." Okay all right so now let's look at 911 and as you can see from some of the video footage it's very suspicious what happened there's other things that are suspicious about what happened first of all a month after the Twin Towers came down all that concrete and steel were shipped to China huh yes the Twin Towers the debris is now in China being put in other skyscrapers who knows okay but that's kind of strange because you would obviously want to run an investigation before you ship that thing off but they did not do the investigation they shipped that debris to China right away that's the first thing second thing is that never in the history of humanity has a fire brought down a skyscraper never before and never afterwards investigators explained that what happened was that the jet hit the uh skyscraper and then because of the explosion because of the gas the steel frame start to melt okay and then when the top melt it start to melt the the um bottom one and the bottom one and the bottom one and and this is what we call a pancake theory never in human history has this happened before except with the three buildings on 911 okay and the third Yeah and then two planes brought down three buildings the last thing is that the plane the explosion was so intense that no bodies were recovered no luggage was recovered but we found their passports okay we found their passports uh these are the 19 hijackers who were who the government decided was solely responsible for the attacks they had no help they had no government help they just acted by themselves and they got really lucky okay luckiest people on the planet as you can see this is their passport that was found on a plane wreckage didn't find any bodies didn't find any luggage but we found the passport so we know for sure that it was a terrorist and no one else this is a boarding pass this is a boarding pass okay found in the debris of the Twin Towers pretty lucky but this is conclusive proof that the terrorists were responsible and no one else okay some more strange things about 911 first of all um we have a document dated to 1962 a document called Operation Northwoods and the plan is for the government to hijack civilian aircraft planes and then blame it on Cuba so that the United States can declare war on Cuba also um 6 months before 911 Fox a television station in the United States they aired a television show called The Lone Gunman okay and the and the um plot is this the government pretends to be terrorists who hijack a plane and crash it into the World Trade Center so they can blame it on terrorists so they can start all these wars in the Middle East what's amazing about the show is that the plane is not being controlled by terrorists it's being remote controlled by government operatives so it sounds almost like exactly like what happened on 911 6 months before 911 happened that's very strange okay it gets stranger this is this man is named Larry Silverstein and he is both the dumbest and the luckiest businessman in the world he's the stupidest businessman in the world because six weeks before 911 he buys the lease to the World Trade Center okay why is that stupid because the World Trade Center has asbestos and like a dangerous chemical so they had to clean or remove the asbestos the problem is the cost of rem of reming all that esbestos would have been more than the value of the twin towers that's kind of stupid okay why would you lease the twin towers knowing that you you have to put all this money into renovation which would bankrupt you also what's stupid is to have the lease you're required to have insurance okay and so the insurance company says we value the World Trade Center at $ 1.5 billion okay and Larry Silver no it's not $1.5 billion they are worth $3.5 billion so he is asking to pay more insurance than he needed to that's kind of stupid but again he's the luckiest man in the world because none of it happens and guess what he can now claim that two towers were struck and therefore he should get twice as much as 3.55 million he should get 7 billion and he sued they went to court and he got 4.55 billion okay he's also lucky because he's he's a workaholic he never misses work but that day because of a dermatology appointment he had to miss work he wasn't there when 911 happened the luckiest man in the world okay so this teaches us that in life do not be um smart just be lucky okay that's all you need all right now I know all this sounds suspicious but there are lots of reasons why we should just believe the government okay why we should believe the United States government is telling us the truth that 911 was um done just by 15 terrorists operating alone running help that JFK was killed by one lone gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald that the moon landing was actually real okay so let's go over the reasons why we should never ever believe conspiracy theories okay the first reason of course is the government would never lie to us okay that's the first reason it's probably the best reason second reason is well the government is too stupid to do anything like this okay they're incompetent okay the third reason is why is there so much evidence that there's a conspiracy theory right if the government is so powerful if they're capable of like doing these conspiracies surely they can cover it up as well why is it on 911 we have all this footage why is it that we have uh the passports why is it that we have like this TV show why is there so much evidence that makes no sense right so the fact that there's so much evidence suggests to us that the government is not involved okay because the government is so powerful that it can just cover everything up right another thing is NASA has 400,000 people working on the space program right why has anyone come forward and confessed why has anyone told the truth that's kind of strange so the fact that so many people were involved but no one has come out and told us what happened means that um the government was telling the truth okay does that make sense it's very hard to keep 4,000 people quiet okay someone might have told a friend or a family member or just might have gotten drunk and then you know done a YouTube video who knows okay but it's very hard to keep 400,000 people under wraps um JFK why not have to kill him in public why not just make it a private thing you know just give him give him some poison he dies no one knows why make it into a spectacle okay so another reason to doubt um conspiracy theory okay and the last thing is if the government was really involved they would not allow us to discuss this right they wouldn't allow me to find this video online they could just cover it all up right all all these videos I've shown you are online so this tells us the government doesn't have anything to fear right okay so we're in a strange situation where we can either believe the government is telling us the truth but then we have all this evidence to suggest that they're not telling us the truth or we can believe that they did this but we all what we also have to believe is that they did this and they want us to know that they did this and they want us to talk about these conspiracy theories okay that's kind of strange well it turns out we have an explanation for this it's called revelation of method the idea is that those who engage in evil must tell you that they are engaging in evil the theory is that those who do conspiracies must tell you they're doing conspiracies and there are three reasons why okay so let's go over them the first reason is the idea of learn helplessness and so the idea is okay let's just say that we everyone knows that they did this right we get angry we write emails we make YouTube videos then what nothing right so the idea of learn helplessness is like the more angry you get the more helpless you feel and therefore the more obedient you become okay that's the first reason second reason is the idea of karmic responsibility and the idea is that the people in power are extremely super or excuse me superstitious they believe that when they die God will judge them okay so we're all dead and God says to the government "Hey why did you do all this evil stuff?" And the government says "No no no i did not act alone everyone participated." Why because I told them what I was doing they didn't stop me they didn't raise any concerns they didn't protest therefore they are complicit okay so another way of saying this is if you just look at 911 if you just look at the moon landing you just look at JFK the evidence is so overwhelming that if you still believe the government it's not because you are ignorant or stupid it's because you are complicit it's because you are involved therefore you share the guilt therefore the karma is spread to everyone okay that's the logic right the third reason is attention capture these events are set up in a way so that they will be remembered forever okay so everyone remembers where they were what they were doing who they were with on 911 when JFK was assassinated during the moon landing okay so you probably were not in United States you might have been in China you might have been tun uh floor uh Tunisia you might have been in South Africa it doesn't matter okay you could have you could have been on the moon okay but you still remember what you were doing on 911 because it's edged into your consciousness and that's the point the point is to control people by controlling people how by controlling how people perceive reality how okay because then you have the power of God okay so these are three ma major reasons why um they will do this evil but they will tell you they did this evil and they want they want you to discuss and continue to discuss why they do this evil okay so even today people are still writing books about JFK people are still writing books about the moonlighting it's allowed because it's attention capture okay it's like the idea of top of mind so if you're a company you don't care about bad publicity all publicity is good because it's top of mind right so if you are hungry and you want to go out for lunch what's the first thing that um you want to eat it's the first thing that comes to mind right so maybe pizza or hamburger okay that's the idea of branding so that's what they're doing here they're trying to control your reality through these events okay does that make sense guys okay any questions all right now what I want to do is look at a question okay let's look at certain questions why is this happening all right so let's look at JFK and 911 and the moon landing what are common characteristics about these three events okay the first thing of course is that they are spectacles you can say that they are rituals a lot of care a lot of attention was put into preparing these rituals so for example the JFK assassination look at the location right look at the um choreography okay they did it purposely in front of people but also in front of cameras so that it'll be remembered forever okay the moon landing as well 911 as well okay um that's the first thing second thing is the idea of numerology so when you look at these events what you'll find is that numerology is very important okay okay it's a very simple concept to understand so for example let's just say you want to get married right well you want to pick an auspicious date so maybe August 8th 88 right or June 6 an auspicious date because that will give your wedding the most chances to prosper you also want to pick pick a nice location fun right same thing with with with this idea okay so look at the let's look at the numerology jfk was November 22nd 1963 11:22 1963 the moon landing was 1969 and then 911 was of course 911 pretty easy to remember right okay now what's interesting is that these are all triangular numbers okay what are triang numbers 1369 right 1369 1963 1969 okay also the number 33 is very very important okay number 33 is almost like a magic number to these people okay and so like what what what we what we believe is that it's secret societies that are responsible for these events okay uh mainly the three masons but there are others as well okay i I'll I'll discuss later number 33 is important okay so look at this 11 + 22 is what 33 okay guys 33 um one one one okay you see how nice this number is 33 is also two triangles right what happens when you put two triangles together you get the star of David which is the flag of Israel okay so number 33 is a very special number for secret societies all right here's something that's that's really also really interesting how about number 33 if you look at the world map okay the equator if you go north 33 degrees you get a lot of places okay the first place you get is uh in Mesopotamia Iraq it's where the tiger is and Euphrates these are two rivers this is where they meet okay why is this important because the meet this meeting place is what we considered the birth of civilization it's a crit of civilization over here is Baghdad baghdad was the capital of the Islamic u golden age the Islamic caliphate okay historical city over here is Damascus one of the oldest cities in the world over here of course is Jerusalem the holiest city for both the Christians and for the Jews okay you keep on going over here to America this is Dallas why is Dallas important because that's where JFK was assassinated but you keep on going and this is like interesting you go to New Mexico and you get to the Trinity test site this is um where the atomic bomb was detonated okay you go over here 33 degrees in Japan do you know what city is 33 degrees north in Japan you mean not Tokyo there are two cities Hiroshima and Nakasaki why are they important okay these are the two places where the atomic bomb was dropped okay think about that 33 north in New Mexico is where they tested the atom bomb and then Hiroshima Nagasaki 33 33 north is where they dropped the two atomic bombs okay all right so why is this important because if you're a secret society what makes secret society important is the mythology or the story that they tell about their purpose okay now it's easy to understand here why 33 degrees is important okay because 33 degrees you're not too hot because you're away from the equator but you're not too cold okay so you can farm that's why all these major cities including Baghdad Damascus Jerusalem are situated 33 degrees north okay also a place called Harappa okay which is the Indis Valley civilization is also 33 degrees north so a lot of major cities are situated in this latitude so that makes sense okay this is the old world what's the old world the old world is obey God okay that's the old world now we go to the new world okay what makes the new new world different well when America was founded there was a religion called theism and theism the belief is that God created the universe but then he went away so the universe is what we make of it okay so now we can be we are God and this is the grand secret of these secret societies they exist in order to do what God could not do or what God can do to replace God so what is it that God does well what the first God does is he changes matter changes matter second thing is he can kill other gods the third thing is he he can create life all right what does change matter mean it means the nuclear bomb right the nuclear bomb so what what what does kill the gods mean it means you can kill president of United States JFK who is considered a prince okay and what does create life it means you create artificial intelligence which is the last step okay so this is part of the mythology the old world is being replaced by the new world okay now if you're able to do all three things now you're able to bring heaven to earth now you're able to declare yourself God and for that what you need is a world government and to show that you are truly in power what you do is you combine the old world and the new world together by making Jerusalem your world capital okay so towards the end of semester I will tell I I will show you what the grand plan is for Jerusalem but for now what you need to understand is that right now in Jerusalem there's something called the alaxac mosque which is the third holiest site in the Islamic tradition it is the place where Muhammad ascended to heaven they plan to destroy the alac mos to rebuild the temple of Solomon called the third temple okay this will start World War II okay because the Muslims will get angry at this and they will come invade Israel and that's the purpose so there's a grand plan to create the world government by initiating World War II okay so uh we'll be discussing this later on in the semester now I want to discuss how secret societies are able to wield so much power okay first of all how is it that they're able to keep everyone quiet right how are they able to maintain their secrets and then how are they able to exert power okay all right so the first thing you need to understand about secret societies is that there are different layers to secret society okay so in Scottish right Freemasonry there are 33 grades 30 33 grades so you start at one and then you slowly climb okay some people can skip and at each different grade you're taught different secrets or understanding of the world so maybe here here here you have four grades okay in the bottom grade all you're taught is just to be a good person to do good works to do charity to be kind that's all you're taught okay but as you as you move up you're taught something else which is um we can do God's work okay god has given us a mission we must do God's work okay and up here is we don't need God okay the higher you climb the more secrets you're told and then the as you move up further you're taught we don't need God okay so guys I'm not part of a secret society i'm just making this up okay i'm just showing you how they might work i'm just spec speculating the last layer is we can be God by killing God do you understand so it's almost like school right in primary school you work hard you learn a lot you go to high school in high school they teach you everything you learn in primary school is wrong let us teach you new knowledge you you work hard you learn all this new knowledge you go to university the professors there are like everything you learn in high school is wrong so let's learn something new okay and then you go to to graduate school and you're taught everything you learn university is wrong okay so that's how these secret societies work so this the word we use is carartmentalized so it's a need to know okay does that make sense you are only taught what you need to know at your grade okay and as you can see the secrets get worse and worse as you climb so how do you maintain secrecy in the system okay so there are two major mechanisms okay the first major mechanism is incentives incentives sorry incentives the idea here is the higher you climb the more power you have okay so these people in the middle all they care about is maintaining a privilege okay so that's so does that make sense incentives okay the higher you climb the more invested you are therefore you want to believe the lie then there's blackmail so if you really want to climb to the top you have to reveal your secrets too so you can be blackmailed okay and we talked about this right the idea of transgression if you really want to climb to the top you have to commit crimes with other people so therefore you can never betray other people okay and the last thing that helps the system is confirmation bias and the idea of confirmation bias is you just want to believe what you want to believe okay people don't want to believe the government lies to them people want to believe the government tells the truth so we like to live in a fantasy world okay so this is what keeps the system intact okay so this is how secret societies keep their secrets does that make sense okay now the question then is how is it that they're able to to wield power and the answer is this structure is perfect for a bureaucracy last before we talked about bureaucracies right how as society matures it becomes more bureaucratic well the problem is that bureaucracies become topheavy too many managers also the idea of silos so each department does its own thing okay and as I said also bureaucrats don't want to do any work so imagine if your secret society how much you can benefit from the system right because you want to work because you want to achieve your vision and you're able to work with other people secretly therefore you're able to promote each other into position of power and because these departments are all siloed off they're all independent you're able to control the entire bureaucracy because you're able to coordinate but they're not okay does that make sense so what we learn is that in history as societies become much more mature as they become much more bureaucratic secret societies have much more power and in and today we are living in a heavily bureaucratic world and therefore the secret societies have more and more power okay and um does that make sense the other thing that we need to remember is that um there are thousands and thousands of secret societies okay so so let's name some of them the Freemasons the Jesuits uh the Mormons the Frankus okay lots and lots okay we'll we'll we'll go over each one later on the semester what you need to remember is that at this stage in development when society's bureaucratic when they become parasites on the bureaucracy they are incentivized to work together to achieve their vision okay but once they create the world government then they will fight each other but at this point in their development they will work and actively collaborate together okay so 911 JFK Moonlanding they were all working together okay so we'll be setting this more as the semester progresses all right so um let's conclude sorry okay okay let's let let's let's let's conclude okay sorry I'm uh Okay so let's talk about the atomic bomb this is Henry Henry Truman okay Henry Truman is the 33rd president of the United States number 33 right he's also a 33rd degree Freemason which is the highest Freemason okay why is it important because he's the one who ordered the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki now this is controversial because at this point America didn't have to bomb n have to nuke Japan why because America was firebombing Tokyo you can see the damage right in Tokyo all the houses are wooden guess what if you drop firebombs on these houses everything burns so America was just burning Japan to death they didn't have to drop the nuclear bombs okay you can see the devastation okay this is Tokyo they burned everything down there was talk that if America launched a land invasion of Japan lots of people would have died but you didn't have to invade Japan because you were just bombing Japan to to ashes so why did they drop the bomb well the other argument is that they dropped the bomb to scare the Soviet Union but that only encouraged the Soviet Union get to get their own bomb right so you have to ask yourself why do they do this and if you go back to the 33 degree story okay which is just explained it gives you an explanation i'm not saying it's right but it offers you a possibility okay okay so as you can see um all these major cities including Babylon including uh Baghdad Damascus um Hiroshima are all part of 33 degree latitude okay guess what guys a lot of famous athletes wear number 33 and they are Freemasons okay so this is Scotty Pippen and and and Shaquille O'Neal we know they are Freemasons larry Bird and Kareem Adul Jabbar also wear number 33 okay um 33 is important jesus died when he was 33 years old the word God Elohim appears 33 times in Genesis king David reigned for 33 years the Vic Pathalon hinduism has 33 dietes human spine has 33 bones okay so number 33 appears over and over so these societies see number 33 as a magic magic number um the moon landing okay I'm not saying the moon landing was faked but there's an argument that it is impossible for humans to leave something called the Van Allen belt okay the Van Allen belt is this electromagnetic field that protects us from cosmic radiation so that the belts themselves have heavy radiation so if you go into it you die but also if you leave the Van Island belts there's nothing to protect you from cosmic radiation so you could die as well so some scientists actually believe that it's impossible to leave Earth okay we'll just die i don't know how they were able to do this and um as you may know right now a lot of countries America China are trying to get back to the moon they're having a really hard time okay they're having a hard time because NASA lost all the technology lost all the footage lost all the data oops oh well okay so so um how was NASA able to keep this secret well guess what a lot of their most important people were Freemasons okay this is Boss Boss Uldren one of the free astronauts he was a Freemason okay um John Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth was a Freemason 33 degree Mason okay um all as was James Webb one one of the first NASA administrators James Webb um Kenneth K um so these people are embedded throughout the bureaucracy and because they're able to coordinate that complete control of the bureaucracy does that make sense so it doesn't matter who's at the top what matters is which barecross are able to work together to achieve their vision this is um Warner von Brown and he was one of the first NASA leaders and he's a German he was actually a Nazi who was brought over after World War II to help America build its space program okay um and he had a he had a friend or a colleague named Carol Rosen and we don't know if this is true okay but what Carol Wilson tells us is that when von Braun died he told us that America the American government was first and foremost concerned about spending weapons sorry spending money on space weapons okay and what and to do this what America will do is continue to manufacture threats to justify all the spending on weaponry okay and then she lists the different threats first they will use Russians okay the Russians we have to defeat the Russians in the space race then they'll be like "You know what terrorists okay 911 then third world countries the craziest like North Korea okay Iran and then an asteroid we we need we need space weapons to protect the earth from asteroids and then the last thing is a fake alien invasion." Okay aliens okay does that make sense okay so we'll talk about this later towards the end end of the semester about a fake alien invasion okay that's part of the plan and they've been seing this for a long time so um I'll conclude by talking about different possibilities you don't have to believe me okay in fact there are I think five different possibilities as to what happened okay the footage looks fake so how to explain this well the first explanation is it's real footage and we should we should just believe the government okay but we we also need to believe that they lost all the footage lost all the technology lost all the data okay that's possibly number one just believe what the government tells you possibly number two is America went to the moon but the astronauts discovered too many secrets on the moon like there are space aliens on the moon they can't tell us so they create this fake footage okay that's second possibility third possibility is America went to the moon but because of the lighting because of the difficulty of filming they couldn't actually take any footage so they made it up to please the American people okay um the fourth possibility is America went to the moon um but they NASA decided to create this fake footage to fool the Soviets right because if it's real footage the first Soviets might be able to copy the technology so we should just fake this thing and make fun of the Soviets okay let's fool the Soviets so they couldn't so the Soviets cannot reverse engineer the success okay that's also a possibility right and the last possibility of course is America didn't go to the moon and it's entirely your choice which possibility to believe okay i'm just proposing different possibilities out there so how can we know the truth well we can use game theory to logically deduce what happened okay so let's use game theory all right so we know that NASA's Apollo program cost $26 billion between 1960 and 1973 that's almost $20 billion today they spent all this money they need to produce a result right this is almost like 4% of all government spending in America that's a lot of money also you don't know this but by 1969 America was falling apart for three reasons first of all America was fighting this pointless and hopeless war called Vietnam tens of thousands of Americans were dying for no reason hundreds of thousands of young Americans were protesting on the streets america the American dream seem to be dying okay that's the first problem second problem is that the Soviets were destroying the Americans in the space race the Soviets were the first to send an animal to space the first to send a man to space the first to orbit um the Earth the first to walk in space the first send a lun lunar modu module to the moon so it seemed as though commis were superior to capitalism it seemed as though the Soviet system was better than the American system okay there's a real fear that the Soviets would get to the moon first okay and also the last thing is remember in 1963 JFK was killed jfk was the prince the king so that put Americans in a very bad mood but but then later on other prominent Americans like uh Robert F kennedy and Martin Luther King they all killed as well so 1969 America was divided was falling apart people felt hopeless right so what this means is that if America sent a mission to the moon and all the astronauts died or they didn't get there America would have been broken okay people would have been depressed and so according to game theory America could not afford to take the risk of sending people to the moon if they died if it failed America would have looked like idiots okay but of course there's always a counterargument the counterargument is okay this makes sense but why did the Soviets call out the Americans and said you guys fake this right what the America and soviet Union were in competition with with each other everyone believed America went to the moon but there's a lot of evidence suggest that it America didn't go to the moon so why why did the Soviets tell the world okay that I can't answer for you all right so I just leave you with this thought okay but what I believe is with the next two years the truth will slowly start to come out and you will see for yourself what really happened so this class is not meant to tell you what happened this class is just meant to give you different possibilities and give you tools to understand or figure out for yourself what might have happened okay all right so any questions before we conclude um as we said uh the secret society might have a um might fighting with the governments but why don't they send their part of their people into the governments why don't they like work together no no they are the government oh okay fine yeah right because they because like secret societies cannot exist outside of bureaucracies right they have power because they're able to coordinate within the bureaucracy in a way that other organizations cannot right so only when the broadcast has reached a certain maturity a certain size can secretist have true power right so secret societies are the ones who control the government basically yeah any other questions okay great guys so we'll continue this next class next week okay all right
