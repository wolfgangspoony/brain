okay so welcome back from the break today I want to talk about an incident that happened in October 2015 at Yale University what happened was this um Halloween is coming up and in Halloween people like to dress up silly get drunk have a good time and a university department called the intercultural affairs committee sent an email to students saying it's Halloween you guys want to have fun that's fine but please be sensitive about the feelings of other people so for example do not dress up like a panda because we have Chinese students and they might be offended if you dress up like a panda okay so this email went out to all the students at Yale and one teacher who works at a resident residential college called Silleon okay so Yale the university is divided into dormitories called residential colleges and she is a dean with her husband of this college called Silleon and to her students she writes an email and says that she didn't agree with the university email she says that a university is a place for you to explore experiment and make mistakes so yes be sensitive about the feelings of others but we trust you to make mistakes and to recover from them okay so um the debate was essentially over safe space versus free space the university said that safe space is important we must respect the feelings of others but the dean of Sillein her name is Erica Kustakis she believes the idea of free space so a university is a place for debate for questioning for experimentation and yes feelings will be hurt that's part of the growing up process the intellectual process so let me ask you a question do you guys agree with number one who argues for safe space or number two Erica Kakus who argues for free space what do you think can sorry can can you speak into the mic please of why do I Yeah why do you believe number two is cor number one and number two is correct oh because I think that university is a place that you could explore yourself you know jump out of your comfort zone and try the things that you never had experienced before okay who disagrees who believes it's more important to respect the feelings of others and like if if the college prohibit these on dressing that maybe be offensive to other uh students it's just in the campus if you like walk out in the society it still will have the people like wants to uh dress maybe like a panda or something so um I think it's I think it's like necessary to like to um to well uh Yeah okay all right any other opinions any other opinions okay so you say we start the rules right i think I think it depends on who decided it feels like for myself I think free space will be more important i need to explore what I want but for being as a leader being as a head of the college I think safe space will be more important for them because they need to take in control okay right but the problem is this is a conflict right if the teachers care about safe space you cannot have free space mhm right so the question then is what do you think in principle is more important free space or safe space safe space okay okay all right okay so yeah so most students believe safe space is more important and this marks a generational shift because when I was growing up there's no debate it was just assumed that free space is more important because if you're not allowed to make mistakes if you're not allowed to explore if you're not allowed to argue with other people if your feelings don't get hurt you will never grow as a person okay so this marks a generational divide or generational gap okay so um we're going to look at what happened because of this debate so the students who read the email were offended that Erica Kristakus was arguing for free space because they believed that by doing this you're going to hurt our feelings all right and so let's look at what happened and remember this is Yale University so what's happening is that when Chris Nicholas Kristakis the husband of Erica Kristakis went to a meeting he was surrounded by students and they're confronting you okay there's like 100 students racism here telling you that you are being racist you were being offensive you admitted that you hurt us why can't you say sorry hurt you i'm sorry one at a time please one at a time it's very easy for any trivial world of mine to be misinterpreted so I'm one at a time i'm happy to speak to you as much as you want i can't speak as much because I have other students that need time as well so unfortunately a little bit okay so look I'm not saying which side is correct okay both sides have legitimate points both sides have problems but you will notice that he the professor he's much older than the students and the students are treating him you can see their faces right they're treating him with some contempt and that's not appropriate and when I was growing up we didn't do this if you didn't like a professor you thought well he's an asshole and but you know what most professors are assholes because they're professors okay you didn't you did not go and like stalk the guy and complain to him that's kind of disrespectful all right so the question then is why is this happening so I want to show you another video and this video is kind of crazy introvertly learn okay this video you understand that as your decision of matter it is your job to create a place of comfort and home for the students that live in Silus you have not done that by sending out that email that goes against your position as master do you understand that no I don't agree with that then then why the fuck did you accept the position because I have Bob hired you okay so this is not appropriate okay again both sides have legitimate points but this is not appropriate right because what she's saying to him is you work for us your job is to make us feel at home and his response is that my job is to help you learn my job is to help you grow and that means openness that means debate that means pain and her response is "I don't want that crap i want to feel good i want to feel at home i don't be challenged." And if you think about it that defeats the entire point of university so again I'm not saying who's right um I'm not saying who's wrong but clearly there's a problem here and when I went to Yale a long time ago we didn't have any of this in fact this sort of incident where a student would curse a professor it was unimaginable to us okay so the question then is why is this happening and there are three explanations for why this is happening the first explanation is parenting these kids grew up in very privileged households and their parents are very protective of them and their parents treat them like friends and so these kids are spoiled okay that's the first explanation the second explanation is the idea of a consumerous mentality so in a university the idea is that the students are consumers the customers and the customers are always right what the customers want you have to give them so if the customers want a safe space they want to come and enjoy their time at university and they don't really challenge that the professors have to meet their demands otherwise he should not have this job okay and this is a mentality that we call neoliberalism or consumerism okay that's the second explanation okay the third explanation is ideological so the idea is that at universities universities are overrun by leftwing professors who teach students that society is racist against minorities who happen to be you know black and female and they must overturn the white racist supremacist structure and you do that by telling white professors who are privileged that they are racist okay so these are three standard explanations for why this is happening because this sort of stuff is happening quite a lot in America what I want to argue to you today is that there's actually another explanation which I think is much more compelling and the explanation is that universities have become bureaucracies before universities existed to teach you how to think to help professors do cutting edge research that helps a society improve or innovate but today universities including Yale Harvard all the universities have become bureaucracies that exist in order to promote the interests of the administrators who want to sit in their office get really nice uh get get a really big salary and feel good about themselves okay that's the argument I will make to you today and what I will show you is that this is not just true for universities it's true for every major organization in America and in the western world and arguably all around the world okay that's the argument I will make to you today any questions before I begin all right okay so today's lecture is death by bureaucracy how the idea of bureaucracy the bureaucratic mindset is taking over the world all right so let's talk about another incident at Yale okay this is Yale Law School and a student named Trevor Colbert he sends an email he has a party he sends an email to all the students at Yale Law School and there there are actually not that many students at Y Law School there's maybe 300 okay but all the students get it and he says that he's going to organize a party and it's it's a trap house party and you know it's it's a bit of a joke because trap house means actually a drug house a place where drug dealers sell uh drugs but black students African-American students read the email and they're offended and they're like "Are you making fun of black students?" So they write a letter of complaint to the deans of Yale Law School and there are two deans who investigate okay their names are Eldic and Koskov okay and they said and what Trevor Cobert does is he actually records the meeting okay secretly 20 for 20 minutes they talk and basically Colbert does not believe he did anything wrong he sent an email and he said it it was a funny email he thought it was funny okay but the deans tell him "You think it's funny but other students found it offensive so you need to apologize and Cobbert's like "Okay well I'll tell you what if these students thought that what I wrote was offensive then I will talk to them we will talk together about why they found my email offensive and we will settle this amongst ourselves." And the dean's like "No no no we want to we want to help you guys out we want to protect you guys we're afraid that you guys meet you guys will fight even more and Trevor Corbert's like "Well I want to hear what they think i don't want to hear this from you i want to hear what they think." Okay and and then what happens is that the deans start to threaten Trevor Colbert they basically tell him "These things amplify over time so you must apologize right away for your sake." Okay and they tell him "Listen if you do not apologize then this might affect your career this might affect your social circle." Okay so they're threatening him and what they say is "We're doing this for your sake." Okay eric says he worries about the email affecting students reputation not just here but when you leave you know the legal community is a small one and he says "You know what i will write the email for you i will craft the apology for you." And cost warns that escalation is a possibility if the student doesn't apologize okay so this is coercion and again the student it's not clear what the student did wrong some students found it offensive but it's not clear what rules or what laws what regulations Trevor Covert broke okay it's not clear so why is this happening okay my argument to you is that it's happening because these guys cost and elic they need things to do because being a dean of a university it's not a real job right they're professors who teach there are researchers who do research but deans actually don't do anything so when you have a bureaucracy bureaucrats go make problems for everyone in order to create solutions for everyone okay so another way of saying this is 20 years ago 30 years ago when I was a student at Yale if you had a problem you had to go talk to a professor because there was no one else to talk to nowadays you can talk to like 20 or 30 different deans dean of student affairs dean of student faculty relation who knows okay but there are like all these offices they can go to and quite honestly the same at the school as well right if you don't like me as a teacher there's like four or five different people you complain you can complain to and quite honestly a lot of you do complain okay so I know about this and and what this is happening is these university have become bureaucracies now the question then is why the bureaucracies and the answer is in the beginning as a university you have to build up your reputation right so you work hard uh you focus on teaching you focus on research so it's a struggle to become a global brand once you become that global brand there's nothing else to do there's no more ideology there's more struggle so what happens is the people in charge start engaging in rent seeking behavior they take advantage of the position in order to make their life easier and then they pass on this privilege to their friends and then to their children and this creates a bureaucracy and the university starts to exist in order to empower these people at the expense of students and professors okay all right so to show you how ridiculous this has become here's an example this is from CNN okay and this is the year 2020 a University of South California professor is under fire for using a Chinese expression students alleg sounds like an English slur okay so there's a Chinese word that sounds like an racial slur an insult in English these two words actually do not sound the same okay you know what the word is right okay they It's not the same as the English word but it sounds a bit similar so what happened was some black students African-American students who are not in his class okay wrote a letter of complaint and honestly if you read it it sounds like a joke it sounds like a prank right so let's read it together let's let's Okay so this is professor Greg Patton and he's just teaching communication Chinese he's just teaching Chinese to his students on how to communicate in China when you do business okay and he and he says "Look nga it's just a feeler it doesn't really mean anything." And he says it a few times but there's no there's no bad intention what he's saying right i mean he's he's just pointing out a fact so what these students write is this phrase clearly and precisely before instruction is always identified as a phonetic hunter and a racial derogatory term and should be carefully used especially in the context of speaking Chinese within the social context of the United States okay so this is a ridiculous idea and honestly it sounds like a joke okay it just sounds like these students are playing a joke and and the prof and the administration just ignore this right guess what happens the dean okay the head of the business school announced that a different professor would take over teaching Patton's class he fired Patton and then he said "Professor Patton repeated several times a Chinese word that sounds very similar to a vile racial slur in English understandably this caused great pain and upset among students and for that I am deeply sorry it is simply unacceptable for faculty to use words in class that can marginalize hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students we must and we will do better." Okay he's being retarded it's a joke it's a prank and and he's taking it very seriously why because he's trying to protect his job he's trying to look good he's trying to explain why I'm the leader because I protect everyone okay so then again what is why is this happening well again the idea of bureaucracy so this is a University of California San Diego this is student enrollment okay so you can see a slight increase in student enrollment but look at this senior management deans administrators managers boom okay boom this is called rent seeeking behavior this is people in power take advantage of their power to give jobs to their friends who do nothing every day and because of that they're always looking to cause problems for everyone else especially professors who do real work okay so let's just look at universities as you can see um the blue is teaching so what's really interesting is that the investment in teaching has gone down okay so the investment in teaching has gone down the blue okay but look at this the red is administration so over the past from 1980 to today over the past 40 years universe have put less money into both um administration as well as maintenance but have put more money into administration into bureaucracy okay this is where your money is going guys all right so this is Illinois you see a massive surge in managers at but the same time student enrollment is going down it went down 3% all right so this is a paper written about the Swedish education system the higher education system system okay it's it's no different anywhere else all right so let's so the argument is that bureaucracy is ballooning in Swedish higher education so let's look at some interesting statistics all right so what's happening is that this chart tells you that teachers are teaching more and more students okay teachers are teaching more and more students but administrators are managing less and less students and the reason why is teachers are fewer and fewer but managers are more and more that makes no sense okay um so you can see that teachers and researchers it's pretty flat okay it hasn't really expand that much but secretaries people who do real work it's going down but managers are going up okay so if the university is facing problems the first thing you should cut are the people who do no work right but it's the opposite people who do no work the managers keep their jobs and in fact they pay themselves more the professors and the maintenance and the secretaries lose their jobs to cut costs okay um this is how much they're paid as you can see over the same time period secretaries are getting paid less and less teachers are getting paid less and less but look at this managers are getting paid more and more uh these are the different departments okay of a university so as you can see okay the the the jobs the departments that do real work IT uh HR they're going down but management is going up right so the people who do absolutely no work their jobs keep on going up and up and they get paid more and more and as I said the problem of bureaucracy is not only do managers do nothing every day but they expect others to do more work okay so professors researchers teachers they're doing more work because the managers are giving them more paperwork to do okay like evaluations and all that so professors spend all now almost 20% of their workday on paperwork given to them by managers and this paperwork is not necessary it's just given to them to justify the jobs of the managers okay this is America we go back to America and as you can see um this is a university called Galidat debt and as you can see over a 20-year period there's a blue are the salaries of professors and it's pretty stable okay you went from 72 to 86 not a huge increase but look for managers okay the president it doubled from 141 to 28 280 it doubled right now the salaries are over three times as much as faculty um this is Connecticut at Yale the president makes $2 million a year at Wesland he makes $3 million a year okay um this is a private university called Stratford University and they went bankrupt right now more and more universities are going bankrupt because obviously you have too many managers and all they do is um get huge paychecks for doing nothing eventually you're going to go bankrupt right so yeah okay sorry to interrupt but the school the school board is not stupid so I mean this is a fact and so why why don't they just change anything that's a great question okay the reason why is they're all friends the school board the president the vice president they're all friends and that's why they can do this because they control all the power they're all friends and it's in their best interest to steal together right because if you steal by yourself then you might get caught but if you steal together then you're untouchable okay so this is exactly what happens at Stratford University the university goes bankrupt and because the president and the vice president are stealing from the university stealing because they are um not only collecting huge paychecks but they're also expensing everything to the university so for example they buy a car or they have a gym membership they charge the university and if the university can't pay for it what they do is they lend money to the university okay all right so Schultz is a president he lists himself and his wife as the biggest creditors claiming that the university owes the couple 2.5 million for eight promisory notes okay so the university could not pay uh their cars or their house mortgages and it's like and the sourc went bankrupt like okay now you have to pay me back all right so so again how were they able to do this because the filings also shed light on payments to university insiders in its final year of operation the college paid out of over 30,000 in segments to seven trustees so the people at the top were getting paid off even as university was going bankrupt though the filing doesn't differentiate which expenses were Richards and which were Maryann's the filings for 2020 alone showed over 18,000 in lease and insurance payments for the shorts cars okay so they had cars and they were making university pay for these cars over 4.7 million in loan payments and collateral return to Eagle Bank on behalf of Schultz okay so they also making the university pay for their houses as well and then you're like how could they do this well the answer is because in America the rich always wins in the court system so whoever is able to hire the best lawyers always wins out and they have a lot of money the university is bankrupt they don't have a lot of money so they will win out okay so I point this out because this is going to what this is what's going to happen to many universities over the next 5 10 years in America because you have a system where you have the managers at the top they all best friends they're all stealing from the university together and eventually the university will bankrupt so that's America okay but it's not again it's not just universities this is every bureaucracy is every organization is happening like this so you look at Canada in Canada you can see a rise of 9% in the population but look at the government okay it's went up by 26% um in America you can see a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs starting in about the 1980s because these jobs are being offshored to China but at the same time you see this steady increase in government jobs okay so people in America are doing less real work and more and more people are becoming bureaucrats okay so as you can see the growth in the government is usually in management okay people will real work no it's pretty flat but look at the managers look at the administrators okay they're going way up and it's a pretty steady increase all right so how do we know the government doesn't really do anything okay so there's a study that shows us that um it's looking at rules okay so rules help society be more efficient so as you can see um the number of rules have gone down actually number of significant rules rules that actually impact you day-to-day have gone way down but this is interesting the paperwork has gone up okay so this tells us the managers the administrators in the federal government of of the United States they don't do anything but produce paperwork that's meaningless has actually no impact on the lives of ordinary people okay okay let's look at the milit military so everyone believes that America has the world's greatest military because it spends the most on the military and has all these high-tech weapons right the problem is a bureaucracy in the military right now so you see what's happening is an increase in management because the ratio of manager officer to soldier is going down okay so you have more officers and less soldiers that's a problem you're fighting a war all right so um in the Civil War and this is the 1860s you had one officer for every 14 soldiers now it's one to four okay the biggest problem is the increase in generals okay so you can see three and four star generals have increased the most in World War II um America had about 12 million soldiers they had seven generals who are fourstar today America has about 1.2 million soldiers they have 40 fourstar generals and this is a huge problem why because if you're a fourstar general you have a lot of privileges beyond your salary so uh this is from Raymond Dubas who works in the Pentagon and he writes about the perks of a fourst star general a fourstar has an airplane a three star often doesn't can a three star get an airplane when he needs it not always okay so a four-star general always has his own personal airplane what is his personal airplane it's called a G5 this is what a G5 is guys this is what a G5 is this is his own personal plane it's always there for him if he if he doesn't want to fly it's waiting on the Tarmac for him okay you can see how luxurious it is this cost 50 to $60 million per plane every four-star general has this plane at the same time guys what's happened to soldiers the soldiers don't have enough to eat there's 1.2 million veterans on food stamps okay that's 8% of all veterans in America the people who actually fight the people actually make sacrifices for their country don't have enough to eat while the generals fly around in like these really nice planes that's a state of the American military all right so it's not just the military it's every single US government department okay all the administrator you see massive increase in administration all right so people who do real work okay is in the red people who do actually no work is in the blue okay so people who do science math engineering 621 people who do administration 1782 so in every federal bureaucracy you have bloat you have managers who do nothing and you don't have very few people people who do the actual real work it's it's it's true for every single federal organization in in America so this just shows you how the ratio of managers and supervisors to other employees what's really funny about bureaucracy is evaluation is very important who does the evaluation managers do the evaluation so at the end of the year they do do they do performance review and what happens is they tell they evaluate themselves and their friends like you did a great job they then look at other people who do the real work and says you guys could do better okay so outstanding is the highest uh performance review for the government right 62 64% got outstanding okay managers who do nothing every day 47% got outstanding for every other job all right so it's a rigged game same same thing with hospitals the the brown is the growth in doctors you can see it's pretty steady but look at the administrators okay the yellow are the administrators it It's blowing up okay and so it c it forces health care costs to go up the reason why healthcare is so unaffordable in United States is not because it has the best healthcare in the world it doesn't it's so it's expensive because it's got so many administrators who do nothing every day all right so what do what do these managers do well the managers always think of new ways to screw everyone else okay so these are health insurance companies and this is their denial rates okay so you work hard for 40 years you pay your health insurance okay and then maybe you get cancer and then you go to the doctor the doctor charges you like a million dollars and you're like you don't have a million dollars but you have insurance so you go to insurance company it's like hey I paid 40 years of insurance fees can you help me out i mean and look the insurance company Unite Healthcare about a third 32% of all claims are denied and they do this as practice because if you fight them they'll say "Okay you know what we'll we'll we'll we'll agree to pay you back." Okay but if you don't fight them then they're like "Great." Okay so it's extremely unethical and so that's what what managers do every day think of new ways to screw over their patients and doctors all right so why is this happening all right why is America like this why is the west like this why why is the entire world like this so this is France Kafka and he was writing before World War I this is his most famous book called The Trial okay i'm not sure if you guys have read this book or heard of heard of this book okay it's very good and the novel it's a very interesting novel because the main character Joseph K he works at a bank he's a blank bank clerk and he has never gotten any into trouble his entire life okay he's very obedient he's very nice he just sticks to himself and then one day the police come and arrest him the police don't tell him why and Joseph K tries to figure out why but he he does not know what he did wrong he does not know why he's being arrested and then he's put on trial and the judge doesn't tell him what he did wrong okay and just in case trying to figure out why this happened to me okay and this and and and this is his answer its purpose is to arrest innocent people and wage pointless pro pointless prosecutions against them which as in my case lead to no result how are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning okay because society has become a bureaucracy and bureaucrats need things to do so they go the police go and arrest innocent people and then send them to trial okay now what he doesn't say is the police could arrest criminals right but the police don't want to do that because the criminals might fight back or the criminals might uh be mean okay they rather arrest an innocent person because they know the person will be compliant okay that's the logic of bureaucrats how do I justify my existence by doing as little work as possible okay so this sounds strange but let me tell you a story this is a true story i'm in Toronto with my two boys and I let them run around the park okay and we've been doing this for two months so I trust them one of my boys he's four years old he runs too far and I lose track of him okay a stranger finds him and starts talking to him but my boy doesn't speak any English so people now surround my boy like where where's where where your parents and he is scared because he doesn't speak any English so he faints okay that that's what he does he faints to protect himself so they call the police they call the par the paramedics they come and they make sure he's all right okay now I find him okay and now the police interview me they interrogate me and I explain to him what happened and at this point they just let us go home right but they insist on taking us to the hospital i'm like if we go to a hospital we could be stuck there for like 12 hours we could be we could be in line and like the paramedics the MAT has already told us there's something wrong with him okay it's not heat stroke he just fainted but he's fine his vital signs are fine but the police kept on insisting meanwhile there's a fight going on at the park okay and I'm thinking to myself why are you guys bothering me and not going to arrest those guys who are fighting somewhere else and the answer is because it's easier to deal with me than to go arrest those guys okay that's how bureaucrats think they're always thinking of ways to justify the existence but not do real work okay and that's the message of the trial eventually society becomes so bureaucratic that the bureaucrats only think about how to make problems for ordinary citizens because life becomes easier for them okay does that make sense all right let's move on to the origins of totitarianism by Hannah Rant henry Rant is a 20th century's one of the 20th century's most uh powerful intellectuals and she's writing about how Nazism came to dominate Germany now communism came to dominate Soviet Russia and how these two regimes led to the deaths of tens of millions of people how they started World War II how they create the Holocaust how they create the famine okay and in her book she she says that these two regimes are religious cults they're evil cults and they have three defining characteristics okay the first is that they're removed from reality they don't care about reality they have a religion they have a faith they have a mindset and they want to impose their faith on reality okay they don't care about reality they're removed from reality that's the first thing okay second thing is that when you're removed from reality your only logic is movement expansion okay you only know if you're right if you're growing okay so if the Nazis their faith their religion would lead to the destruction of Germany but their membership was increasing so they were right they were winning these wars against European countries therefore they're right okay they cannot use logic to explain their actions so they use movement to expl to justify their actions okay that's number two one and two means number three which is the Nazis and the Soviets hated reality they defied reality they fought against reality so even though the Nazis were losing the war even though it's clear they cannot defeat the Soviet Russia they doubled down because in their religion movement is what matters defining reality is what matters and that's what led to the destruction of Germany okay all right so and she explains that tot regimes have these three characteristics they're removed from reality all they care about is expansionism and they want to defy reality as their true test of faith what she does not say in the book is that these three can can apply to all bureaucracies all governments meaning that over time all governments all bureaucracies will tend towards totalitarianism because they have that's the only way they can justify their existence okay does that make sense all right so let's talk let's talk about this concretely okay what do I mean by this so this is a book by James Scott it's an excellent book by the way uh called Seeing like a state and he's trying to explain to us how brock bureaucracies work how governments function and for him governments actually create more problems than they solve why well he lists four reasons the first is that he all they care about is the administrative ordering of nature and society so so another way of saying this is a bureaucracy is a machine it's a hierarchy it's static it's mechanical but society is like a forest it's diverse it's an ecosystem it's organic for a state to exist it must turn the forest into a machine like itself so it destroys diversity it destroys spontane spontaneity it destroys imagination okay all right so let let's use an example of this all right so my question to you is like who are you can can you can you tell us who who are you like like who are you as a person tell us who you are as a person like my Yeah yeah just just use one or two minutes to to to introduce yourself who are you as a person hi my name is Banker and I I grew up in Beijing uh and I came to Moonshot this this school in 2024 last year and uh okay wrong wrong okay that's that's not the correct answer the correct answer is you're a teenage boy oh okay that's the correct answer all right you believe that you are an individual with individual aspirations ambitions with a past with a history the state doesn't care the state needs to classify you in a way that can that I can use you okay you're a teenage boy which means like two years time you can be employed in a factory or I can send you to war okay that's all I care about okay i don't care about your name i don't care about who you are i don't care who your parents are i don't care about your past i don't care what you like all I care about is the fact that you are a teenage boy and therefore I can I can exploit you for labor okay that's how states think okay so the batization of society second is the idea of high marers ideology so because the state is a monopoly democracy is a monopoly it becomes arrogant it has hubris it's overconfident and it it wants to impose its ideology on everyone else it believes that through its own planning it can achieve paradise okay um so it becomes authoritarian meaning it refuses to listen to criticism to feedback to questions it does it is not open to debate it in it imposes its will on people okay which creates a weak civil society and if if as an organization you're not getting feedback you're not allowing for openness then you will wither and die okay and that's why states governments will always fail in the end okay so he uses two examples the first example is what happened in the late uh 19th century Germany so in Germany there's there's lots of forests and the state is thinking of ways how can we how can we best monetize the resource of the forest well there are certain trees that you can cut down for lumber right the problem is that in a forest most space is occupied by useless shrubs or greenery or trees okay so their idea is you know what here's a simple solution we'll burn on the forest and just plant trees that we can harvest for lumber right brilliant that's a brilliant use of space it's more efficient the problem though is that when you do that the trees are now are susceptible to disease to weather changes a forest is resilient because it's diverse okay so that's what this what Scott says monocultures are as a rule more fragile and hence more vulnerable to the stress of disease and weather than poly cultures are any unmanaged forest may experience stress from storms disease drought fragile soil or severe cold a diverse complex forest however with its many species of trees its full complement of birds insects and mammals is far more resilient far more able to withstand recover from such injuries than pure stance so nature has diversity because it allows for resilience okay some part of the forest can die but the rest of the forest will recover from anything whether it's disease or drought or weather okay and we humans are the same way if you let humans do whatever they want we are resilient so some communities might die off but other communities will adapt the problem with a state with a government is that it refuses it sees diversity as an enemy okay so if there's a natural disaster it's very likely that a lot more people die off than otherwise okay another example is force communism in Tanzania okay okay so it's a top- down system and their idea is okay these farmers have their little small farms and they grow their crops but that's not efficient what if we just got all the farmers together and had coffee and they all you know had coffee uh or wheat or whatever and then we can sell this to other countries okay and of course you can imagine that this will lead to starvation because it's the same principle as the forest if there's a weather crisis or if there's a disease then all your crops die off and then your people die off okay what these planners carried in their mind's eye was certain aesthetic what one might call a visual codification of modern rural production and communicate community life okay so the problem with bureaucrats is they have no imagination everything to them has to be mapped out they like things that can be mapped out that can that can be a blueprint okay they like to brag about these things because because that's how they see the world but real world nature requires diversity it requires organic okay all right so he gives examples of how the state transforms society so before what would happen is that people would just come together and they will organize their communities according to their needs okay it's a bottomup process but the state wants to create permanent cities where people are just in one place all the time right that's why you have cities um before what's natural is just for people to live on small farms and share stuff with other people to trade with with each other the problem with this is the state cannot tax you so what the state does is it brings you to cities makes you work in a factory so it can tax you okay the point of giving you a wage is so it can tax you to exploit you um property um before it was very common for people to share property together okay now there's it's all owned and controlled by the state uh resources are the same thing before people just use resource according to needs but now the state wants to centralize these resources okay so it can tax and exploit people properly okay so that's what a state proxy does so what are the consequences of the over bureaucratization of society well what's happening in America is that while consumer goods like cars clothing and cell phones are going down what's going up are hospital services schooling okay housing why because these are monopolies controlled by bureaucrats right so what's happening is with the over bureaucratization of society it's almost impossible for middle class people or people to have a good life now okay here's another really interesting chart the black shows you the growth in the stock market okay and you think you think wow this is a good thing okay the problem is first of all only 10% of people in United States control most of the stocks over 90% of the stocks the other issue is this the other issue is if you look at prices yeah it's gone up but if you just turn but if you look at stocks as a units of gold if you use gold to buy stocks guess what the price of stocks have gone down that's a blue okay if you use money to buy stocks it goes up but if you use gold to buy stocks it goes down what this is telling us okay very simple is we are living in a lie all this wealth generation it's all a lie it's not real we just think it's real we We're living in a fairy land created by bureaucrats to fool us to believe that we are prosperous okay does that make sense the amount of gold that you can buy with stocks has gone down okay and so the blue is the gold the black is money the money isn't is worthless okay all right another problem that bureaucratizing has created is people don't want to work anymore so in America this is called quite quitting in China it's called tonging or banan okay lying flat let it rot people don't want to work anymore why because it's pointless to work in a bureaucracy right leaders don't care the organiz doesn't need you you are alienated you are told what to do and you cannot negotiate you cannot rise from the bureaucracy you're you're being asked to work too too much you feel as though you're just a machine okay and so you're and so the way you rebel is lying flat or quite quitting okay so your overure of society means that people now have become more lazy more complacent more more indifferent and what this also means is that democracy is declining because people's voice people people's power is declining okay so you can see that people feel as though democracy is in the decline in fact experts um estimate that democracy the capacity for people to participate in politics the capacity for people to influence politics has declined rapidly these past 10 years okay so we are living in a world that is becoming more and more bureaucratic and it's killing us okay all right questions so as you say we now live in a very corrupt world so we live in a bureaucratic world yeah bureaucratic world so what so I I I can't really see the future of no matter it's the mankind or like are there any good side of the current world okay what what are what are the good things about the current world well the good um side is that because things have become so corrupt people now are forced to think for themselves right before you could just trust your teacher you just trust your parent you just trust author authority figures but now you see them for the bureaucrats that they are and so now you're forced to think forced to think for yourself and so you're now forced to educate yourself you're now forced to explore different opinions so people's minds are opening and that I think is a very good thing in today's world okay any more questions so will it help if we cancel uh most of the managers and just like keep one one or two of them like Yeah okay so that's a really good question okay if this is a problem why not just get rid of the managers and the answer is they have all the power okay they would much rather send you to war and kill you off than to tend to lose their jobs okay so going back going back example of Straford University that's that their mentality is how do I maintain my privilege they don't care about society all they care about is maintaining their privilege right so they are bankrupt society and then when society becomes bankrupt they expect society to still continue to pay them off okay so these are parasites and there's nothing we can do about it yeah um as we just said are there less teacher and less professor or like le like like most of people would choose to quite quitting then who are they going to control if there's less people to work for them you know okay that's a really good question they don't think like that they don't think about how efficient is my organization They don't think about like am I going to have a job in the next 5 years all they care about is maintaining the position right here and now okay the way they do that is they hire their friends or people like them into other manage management positions so they become like a cabal or or a network onto themselves and for them they they become parasites and what parasites want to do is they want to feed off the host the host dies what's going to happen they will switch to another host right why because they're all part of larger networks as well so that's how they think they're thinking well you know as long as society survives I will continue have a job okay so maybe this university goes bankrupt but there's another university I can go to and exploit and and you know what it works okay because people at the top protect each other right okay does that make sense they don't care about this hole this hole they don't care about this organization they don't care they don't care if it goes bankrupt because they can always move on to another organization to bankrupt okay what matters is to maintain their patronage the political networks so they all help each other okay does that make sense okay great any more questions um is there any possible to uh stop or even reverse this u cooperating system yeah um I keep on explaining this this this okay they are the ones in power and so what has to happen is society has to collapse before society can regenerate before society can rejuvenate okay but before society can collapse they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves okay so for example they can create civil wars where the left and the right fight each other and they're left alone or they can use AI to control you right ai is God guys listen to God okay or they can fake an alien invasion okay or they can send you to war they can start these pointless wars okay but whatever it takes in order to maintain their privilege and their power that's a mentality and that's how they got to where they are okay okay and that's how the elite think any more questions guys okay Mr j my question is um so I'm a 12th grader so if you are in my shoe like if you are in a 12th grader in nowadays what would you do like are you still going to pursue for a further education a higher education or will you going to like just drop out yeah okay that is a great question so you are you guys are about to go to university and as I told you in this class university is a complete ripoff okay all you're doing is you're paying for the nice salaries and perks of these administrators at university you're not really paying for the professors all right you're paying for the administrators to have their nice lives and so what I would do is maybe not go to university what I would do is focus on education on learning by reading a lot of books by um asking a lot of questions and doing my own research by learning real skills okay so in a site like this where the game is rigged going to university means that you'll just lose okay maybe before like 20 30 years ago it was good to go it was good to go to university because you might become a manager but now all those slots have been taking taken up by the elite and the children okay there's no space for you so the only thing you can do in this context is to really start educating yourself in real knowledge all right reading books um meeting lots of different people exploring the world okay like really develop real knowledge okay that's that's the best solution right any more questions does it matter to the major does it matter to the major no it does not matter the major it's all a scam okay okay it's all a scam even for liberal arts uh it's all a scam okay doesn't matter what university you go to liberal arts Ivy League state it's all a scam doesn't matter what your major is economics psychology humanities computer science it's all a scam okay the system exists so that the managers administrators can continue to feed off the system all right okay guys so uh we'll continue this next week okay all right but thank you for the questions
