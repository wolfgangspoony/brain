so we continue um our run through h a run through of human history today so last class we did cave paintings and what I will do from now on is I will highlight some YouTube comments um for for us to review what we learned last class but also um as a chance for us to better engage the YouTube audience okay so this comment comes to us from Gary Zorakiski and he talks about the K paintings he says that um it is possible they created art everywhere the paintings only survived in the caves and the answer is absolutely so back then during the ice age they made these cave paintings as a ritual as a celebration of their religion to express their imagination they really didn't care about leaving a legacy that comes later okay so that's a very important comment so thank you um this man says that when I was talking about Beethoven uh he points out that Beethoven wasn't born deaf he became deaf much later as an adult and that is true um so but one thing about Beethoven that people don't really discuss is that he probably had symphysicia okay and this is just a fancy word meaning the mixing of senses so some people are born with a special talent and so what happens is that their senses get mixed up so when people hear things they actually see things okay so the classic example is that they have pitch perfect so there are some people musicians when they hear something they they exactly what the pitch is is it C um minor D uh major okay and the reason why is when they hear something they see a color okay so they mix the audio sense with a visual sense and that's part of the situation with Beethoven as well so a lot of really talented people in life what happens is that they mix up their senses okay um another person is Leonard Uler who was a mathematician and uh this YouTuber says that the pirate the pirate bay he says that uh he probably did his best work after he went blind and the reason why is that when you go blind um you're able to imagine much more strongly and much more deeply okay so he's able to see the math in his head okay um this man says that I also learned from indigenous people that they don't produce trash and garbage and that's something that's very true for most of of human history for most of human history we saw ourselves as part of nature and so when you go to someone's house you don't leave trash um same thing for primive people okay they saw themselves as interconnected with nature and so they have to respect nature and therefore um they had to keep it clean okay all right so from now on we'll just have highlight some YouTube comments okay so let's talk about heaven on earth so we did the ice age and now what's happening is that the um planet it's warming up and allows for agriculture it allows for settlements okay so now we will discuss today what happens during this time as the population grows and as we settle down to form um cities okay so let's review what we learned last class because in this class we don't learn facts or places um we learn about ideas and concepts so if you want to understand human history you need to internalize certain concepts so in history class um in our culture you're taught certain myths about who we are okay so I'm going to go over some of these myths and show you they're wrong explain why we have these myths okay so the first myth is that we are materialistic we like money sex and power okay the truth of the matter is that throughout most of human history we had three goals or three concerns the first is that we have a religious impulse and we want to express this religion through art through music through dance and when I mean by religion I mean that we have three questions in our heads the first question is where do we come from second question is why are we here and the third question is where are we going that's why we had religion to answer these three questions okay and that's why we still have religion today second thing about us is that we're all diverse and we want to differentiate ourselves we want to stand out the last thing is we are curious and we want to explore that's fun fundamentally who we are then the question then is why are we telling you that we're materialistic and the answer is it's better to control you okay so in a society there's a hierarchy and the people in charge they want you to work hard they want you to be obedient but if you believe that um you want to explore then you're not going to be obedient enough okay does that make sense okay second myth is this is going to be hard for you to understand what you're taught is that the nuclear family father mother children that's the most natural human unit and it's not true actually if you look at most ancient societies the most natural um organization is that women are usually in control why because women have complete autonomy over their bodies so they can choose who to have sex with and that's where the power comes from they control access to to sex which gives men pleasure and um with this power they often choose to sleep with as many men as possible okay and there are three reasons why they choose this strategy the first is it's fun okay it gives them pleasure to have sex with as many men as possible that's number one number two is women are really good at negotiating politics and they use sex as a political strategy so if two guys are fighting each other she has sex with both and then voila they're best friends now okay so women are very good at managing emotions through sex okay and then number three is the most important if you're a woman you want to make sure that all your children grow up successfully they don't die okay and they're happy and they're healthy so from your perspective it's in your advantage to hide paternity to hide the fact who the father is why because now all the men in the village in the community are responsible for raising a child because no one knows who the real father is so everyone assumes that I could be the father okay and this is historically um how societies are usually organized with the woman in charge and as such societies tend to be very egalitarian because women don't really care about status and power they care about harmony and balance and the question then is why did we change there's actually a very simple reason the simple explanation is in order to have produce more children because if you're a woman you don't want to have too many children you want to make sure that all your w all your children have access to resources but you also want to stay healthy right if you have too many children it's possible you could die in child birth it's also possible that your children die in child birth as well so women have always practiced population control but we when we switch to a uh patriarchy now we can have as many children as possible okay because now women are basically become slaves and their main duty is to have as many children as possible and that's why after this transition from matriarchy to patriarchy a lot of women start to die okay so that's number two number three is humans believed in survival of the fittish and that's not true historically if you look at how societies are organized we tend to be compassionate we look after the ill we look after the elderly we look after the weak okay that's who we are we have empathy we care about other people so why do we believe uh in survival the fittest it should create fear and anxiety okay if you have fear and anxiety you work harder but also you're easier it's easier to control you any questions so far okay all right let's continue number four humans have gotten smarter over the centuries and uh one one thing that you will learn in this class is that's not true humans have always been smart but we've expressed our intelligence in different ways so uh printive cultures they express uh themselves through art they had better memories they had more they were more sensitive and they were more resilient than we are so why are we taught that we're smarter the answer is confirmation bias because everyone likes to believe that we're smarter than the people who came before us okay so now let me give you an example of how smart they were so let's just say that you have a boat and you want to navigate the Pacific okay that's very hard to do and you usually need a computer why because there's so much information that you need to process in order to navigate the ocean okay so let's go over some of the information all right so these are the Polynesian people what's amazing about them is they settled the entire Pacific wherever there's an island they had a settlement and this is a testament to our desire to be to explore the world okay what is fascinating is how they did this because if I were to put you in a boat in the Pacific you'll probably die okay and that's true for most people so the question then is how do they navigate the Pacific well what they did was this they built boats that allow them to navigate Pacific but as you can see these are not large boats okay so they had to get to an island fairly quickly so what they needed to do was read the stars so in their heads they were they were able to map out the stars and from the stars figure out exactly where they were they also had to memorize oceanic currents okay how the oceans were moving in order to better navigate the ocean also every island has its own distinct oceanic ecosystem okay so there's so much information that they have to take in they have to look at the wind they have to look at the oceanic currents have to look at the stars and that's why we have computers to do this for us today but back then they didn't have computers so they had to do this all in their heads okay and they had some maps that help them okay so this is a a map of the stars and this is a map of the oceanic currents but they were all doing this in their head and what's really amazing is while they were out in sea they couldn't sleep okay they have to keep track of all this information to know exactly where they were were if they fell asleep the navigator fell asleep they got lost and then they died okay that's the power of the human imagination okay last myth we evolve from apes and the truth is that we are imaginative and we can choose our own evolution okay so um you're taught in school about the theory of evolution how we evolve from apes and maybe our bodies evolve from apes but our minds did not our minds come from somewhere else okay so why are you taught we evolved from apes it's to it's to justify the power power hierarchy okay right all right the people in charge are just stronger and better and more fit than we are all right so having revealed last class let's now talk about um the religious imagination okay so this is the pyramids um it was built 2400 BCE um and today it's the same pyramids this is one of the most Yes yeah go ahead um you said that that the the uh previous people are like smarter than today's because they can uh navigate the Pacific like just with the boat and and the and and don't sleep but nowadays we use computer right uh but I think that uh nowadays we use computer is not because that we cannot uh navigate the ocean just by a boat and and and human is because uh this manner is we could add more precise and accurate information okay that's not true okay if I put you on a serial computer you would die it's it's that simple okay the computer's not going to help you navigate the ocean okay all right all right so um these are the pyramids okay and there's a great mystery as to how these pyramids were built and you might have on the internet heard sill explanations like aliens came and built the pyramids okay or maybe the lost civilization of Atlantis gave the technology to the Egyptians to build the pyramids and this is an example of confirmation bias we think that we're smart and everyone before were stupid okay and what and what you'll learn in this class is that these people had an imagination that allowed them to build the pyramids okay so I'm going to show you how they built the pyramids all right so as you can see the pyramids are extremely complex structures okay and first of all there's debate as to what the pyramid is what are you taught in school what the pyramids are what is it come on you guys are taught all this in school right the two pyramid is what it's a tomb right okay guys it's not a tomb okay it looks like a tomb but it's not a tomb it's a temple right okay so how do they build the pyramids um so what happened was that they didn't have blueprints have computers but they had the imagination so they could see the building of the pyramid in their heads and what they did was they actually built it from the inside out okay all right so again it's hard for us to imagine that they would do this because it's like wait you don't have a pen so you couldn't write it down you have a computer so you can process all the all the information they did it all in their heads and that's the power of the human imagination okay all right um and as you can see it was a massive undertaking huge organization it took about 20 years and lots and lots of people and then the question then is how were they able to organize in such a manner and the answer again is empathy the imagination someone had a vision and this vision was so compelling that everyone knew exactly what part to play okay also what's really important is that in school you're taught that the pyramids were built because the pharaoh is God and there's a tomb for the for the pharaoh okay that's really insulting to the Egyptian people like all cultures the Pharaoh wanted what's best for his people okay so the Pharaoh would in his lifetime undertake a lot of public works projects okay including canals okay so that so the pyramids were just a public works project a temple um what's amazing about the pyramids is that we could not do the pyramids today okay back to your point we have computers guess what we have all these machines okay and guess what we cannot build the pyramids why well because the way we work is different from the way they worked before let's go over the differences okay ancient times people had religious devotion when they worked on a project like the temple like like the pyramids or whatever the point was to bring heaven to earth to bring God to earth to create eternal peace they felt that my dedication my sacrifice would make my children my grandchildren my great-grandchildren all more prosperous okay that's why they worked so hard today it's make more money okay second thing vision people back then had bigger brains okay not bigger brains but like stronger imagination so in their heads they were able to see the entire vision in their heads and this vision was a was able to pass on to other people as well it was almost like they had telepathy it was almost like they could see the same thing okay the structure of the parent was designed in a way that people saw the same image and they work towards that image today we focus on something called top- down process oriented management okay the idea here is rather than work together you just go and work a particular part and then once you do that part you go away okay so an example is maybe art class now I'm not sure if you take art class but you guys know like to produce a great piece of art you stay in a room and you work really hard at it okay but in school what do we do well first we do is first thing we do is make you write a plan right and you do the plan well I give you 10% then after you do the plan what do you do you write the outline then you do a draft then you do an iteration okay you understand we break it down in a process and you think that this would lead to better results it actually leads to worse results okay because you're no longer focused on the vision you just focus on the process and that's why today everything we do sucks okay i can give you the greatest computers in the world and you really couldn't do the pyramids okay i I can give you the best machines the best computers it wouldn't matter because you lack that vision the last thing this is most important is when you have vision when you have religious purpose everything you do is careful okay you put your best effort into doing it because you're trying to create eternity today you try to do the least amount of work for the most amount of pay right so the idea today is to do it as fast as possible as cheap as possible to maintain the budget okay so do you understand it's not about how smart you are it's about your purpose in working it's about how you work and that's why everything we do today is just crappy okay all right uh let's go over some examples of tremendous human achievement okay this is the Haga Sophia um and this was built in 532 in Kenapole it's still instant you can actually take a plane get on a plane and fly and it's still there guys okay this is a modern picture so you can see the amount of attention and care put into architecture back then okay because it's about bringing heaven to earth creating heaven on earth this and you can see inside how beautiful it is okay and so every inch every piece of the church is just beautifully constructed everyone who worked on it was working with the same vision and working with the same dedication this is the Aken Cathedral built in 1790 okay and guys this is what it looks like today no different from what it looked like when it was first built and guys no one said this was built by by aliens okay no one said this was built by the Atlanteanss so the idea that the Egyptians couldn't build the pyramids by themselves and have to rely on aliens that's just a racist comment okay um also Charlemagne the first Roman emperor the first Holy Roman Emperor he was buried he's buried inside this cathedral but no one's saying this is a tomb okay we all know it's a church so the pyramids are a church a temple to their gods and once you understand that then we can better understand how they built the pyramids okay does that make sense okay and this is what it looks like inside okay again this is today you can actually get a plane go to Germany and go walk inside this church and see for yourself how beautiful it is back then they put care and love into everything they did because because they believe that what they did was to make a more godly spiritual world okay minute Manhattan project okay this is probably the greatest achievement of humans in the 20th century all right and there were 100,000 of scientists who worked on the Manhattan project to build the nuclear bomb same concept where they believe that they were creating eternal peace on earth heaven on earth and that's why they worked so hard and guess what they were right right because now with the atomic bomb nations are afraid to go to war before the atomic bomb World War I World War II killed tens of millions of people and even though they're still wars they're not as devastating as before okay all right so this idea of bringing heaven to earth it goes way back to the beginning of humanity this is go Goblé Teepe um it was first built in 90 in 9600 9,600 B.CE and this considered the world's first temple it's the first temple that we discovered we can assume that wherever humans go they will build temples because as I mentioned last class humans are first and foremost religious they express themselves through the especially religion through art architecture music dance okay and it's an amazing achievement um because these pillars okay they're really tall so we don't know how they were able to move these pillars into place okay you can see how small people are how big this is but if you think about what we said about having a vision and then working together to achieve this vision then it makes more sense okay so let's discuss how they were able to build Pepe and this process is important for us to understand because it repeats itself throughout human history okay so let's go over the process okay the first is that there's always a charismatic leader it could be a man it could be a woman but he or she has a vision for creating a temple a place of God okay that's what a temple is it's a play it's a place for God to live on earth and he shares this vision with everyone and everyone works hard to achieve this vision okay but then the leader dies and now you have different people competing to be the new leader okay why because a temple and this really important for you guys to remember a temple is always the most valuable real estate on earth okay if you if you are in a temple people come to pray to you right so they have to give you gifts they have to give you tribute so what's happening in this time is that they would organize a religious festival um once or twice a year and people would have to bring gazelle had to bring food as a tribute to the um priests and then they would celebrate it together and then they would um feast okay so if you're able to control this temple you lived a very good life you were a very powerful person okay and so there was so when when the first leader died you would have secession crisis and they would vote who the next leader would be and so what happened is they would have these trials where they prove to each other who the god's favored okay so it's possible maybe there are two hills okay you stand on one hill I stand on another hill and we'll see where the bird lands if the if the bird lands on my hill then the gods favor me okay because at this time um humanity believed that the mother goddess ruled over all because because if as humans at this time you're concerned about two things right you're first concerned about farming agriculture fertility and then you're concerned about having babies okay so that's why the mother god was important because the mother goddess provided fertility for everyone okay um but then over time what they realized is you know what we just cheat okay and how do How do you cheat you cheat by forming secret societies okay by getting people to follow you and then you swear blood oath to each other and you also maybe have sex with each other and you become a faction okay and this led to logo conflict and the way they set they often settled this uh dispute or debate is for human sacrifice okay so if your faction lost you'd all be sacrificed and we know this because under Gobl there are tombs okay of human remains so we assume that um these people lost a power struggle and as such they were all sacrificed together okay so in other words power struggle political conflict uh religious dispute human sacrifice secret society they go all the way back to human society okay all right so this is go tepe today again you can you you can get on a plane flight to turkey and then go visit go play teepe now one thing that's really important for us to understand is that with our architecture there's mythology in place okay and here we assume the mythology is the mother goddess with a bird in the sky and this might be a human skull okay so there's a very complex diverse mythology in place we don't know what it is okay but they had a sophisticated mythology and also remember humans are diverse so once the mythology becomes established new people come to establish a competing mythology okay so um this place is called Karanepe and as you can see the mythology of this place it's different but these places are very close to each other okay so this is maybe the cult of the skull the idea here is when people die you can still communicate with them in the spirit world if you have their skull okay almost the skull becomes a portal into the afterworld okay so you can draw on their wisdom you can draw on their spirit with the skull and this called the skull we see this in many ancient cultures including in China okay it's what we call ancestor worship and as you can see uh this is a cult of skull okay the Tower of Jericho the Tower of Jericho is another settlement and we just assume that okay if it's a tower it's for defensive purposes okay it's to ward off invaders but there's actually a better much better explanation for the Tower of Jericho it's a religious temple why because during the solar equinox the sun hovers above the of the temple and it causes the temple to flood this area with shadow okay so if you are a religious person you feel as though heaven is coming to you directly okay so you have a ritual you have a celebration when the solar eclipse happens and you can feel as though you're ascending to heaven or heaven is coming down to you okay that's a Howard Jericho okay kak Hoyak kai Hoyak is one of the first settlements that we found remember Kepe um is just a temple so they they would go there maybe once or twice a year for a religious celebration but then they would leave okay kak is where they decided to settle down permanently for decades now in school you're taught that we started farming because it allowed us to access more food and so we could grow the population we will become healthier and stronger okay but if you actually dig up bodies of hunter gatherers as opposed to farmers what you'll realize is one hunter gatherers are taller a lot taller than farmers hunter gatherers are stronger live longer healthier they have better teeth why because if you're a farmer um you so sorry if you're a kind of gatherer you have access to lots of different food right meats and and getting the food is actually pretty easy okay you can just pick fruit off a tree as a as a farmer you have to work really hard to grow food that's not very nutritious and often the food is just similar okay you're just eating one vegetable one crop okay it's very limited diet and also because of starch your food your teeth gets really rotten really fast okay also because you're living together in a close quarters it's really easy for diseases to spread okay so um it's hard for us to appreciate this but being a hunter gather it's an easy happy healthy life being a farmer sucks so the question then is why they become farmers for religious purposes right so that they could settle down and be with their religion okay be with a charismatic leader okay does that make sense all right so this is Khoic this is the this is this the religion of the mother goddess okay and accompanying the mother goddess is the bull okay because if you think about it a woman cannot give birth by herself she needs a male and this male god is the bull who represents vility energy strength okay so they worship both as you can see how people are worshiping the bowl uh this is an image of Kakoya it's a very sophisticated community it's also very egalitarian and each house is a temple onto itself okay each so they have these paintings in order to bring in the energy of their gods that they worship and that's why they want to stay here because they want to be with their gods even though it meant a harder life for them okay this is um Katak as you can see it's beautiful this is what it looks like today okay all right this another image rendition of Katak okay as you can see each house is a temple on to itself and they bury the dead underneath okay so they're trying to um practice a religion like here okay as as I mentioned each house is a temple onto itself as you can see how each house is elaborately decorated with you know the bowl with ornaments to their gods and to the religion um this is a gazelle so they hunt gazelle for food but as you can see it's really a dance right so they're hunting the gazelle but they see it more as a dance as a c celebration the reason why is at this time in history we feel an obligation to the animals we killed we have to thank the animals that we killed we have to celebrate the animals we killed in order to maintain balance and harmony in the world okay it's almost like a contract before you can kill animals you need to pray to the gods and ask for for permission after you kill the animals you must fetg the animals for sacrificing their body to you so you can you can uh eat okay all right you guys got it all right so let's go over the pattern of human settlements okay and I I need you guys to remember how this process works so let's look at how Kat came came together and I'll explain to you why it fell apart again you have a charismatic leader who has a messianic vision he takes us to this place and says this is where the gods are this is divine place and let's settle down here and and as such we can bring heaven to earth and then they be become a creative artistic community okay and they often choose a place where the climate is very nice and allows them to farm to supplement um their hunting gatherer okay and over time as a population grows they become much more dependent on um farming okay so so it's a gradual process that doesn't happen overnight in the early days there's lots of social mobility in that all leaders are elected and also it's very egalitarian okay does that make sense but over time the system breaks down what happens well first thing that happens is because of overpopulation there's too much stress on the environment and so you have um the land uh you're not you're not able to grow as much on the land then you have climate change happening as well okay another big issue is that the hierarchy becomes hereditary before the leaders were elected now they are just inherited okay and this leads to corruption where the elite bully and exploit everyone else and people forget the memories of the first days and so what do people do people just get up and they leave okay do you understand you can always choose to leave and so if you don't like the community anymore you and your family just get up and you go to another place to build a new community based on your principles okay all right so based on today's lecture I want you to remember three things about how we humans come together in a community okay and these three basic principles are almost like laws i want you to remember them and then these laws will help you better understand how societies rise and fall okay the first important principle I want you to remember is societies are fluid and dynamic they're always changing over time okay okay they're never still second thing is that diversity within societies is greater than across societies so another way of saying of saying this is yes there's a conflict between United States and China but actually if you actually look at differences in diversity the difference diversity within China is greater than the difference between China and the United States okay does that make sense okay the third law is communist exist in opposition to each other okay so think about the cities in China okay uh Beijing Shanghai Shenzhen Chungdu they're all different why because they want to be different from each other okay but also within Beijing you have Haiden Tayyang different districts right they're all different from each other because they want to be different okay so these three laws will help us better understand how societies form thrive and ultimately ultimately die okay all right so I'm going to go over some books to highlight certain issues that we discuss in this class this is a thought of everything uh by David Grabber and David Wangro who are both anthropologists okay and they've looked at different societies and what they emphasize is diversity the dynism of different societies okay so let's look at one particular society which is the native people of of the Canadian northwest coast okay these are the native people and what happens what's really interesting is throughout the year they have different social structures so during the winter everyone comes together and they form a hierarchy where there are palaces where there's an aristocracy um and where the different they're divided into different classes okay but then what's really interesting is that during the summer people will just go away and start new societies okay this is like really interesting how in different times of the year when the needs are different people will choose different social organizations okay people actually adopted different names in summer and winter literally becoming someone else depending on the time of year okay so a metaphor that you can think of is think about how when you play World of Warcraft or a different video game you adopt a different identity you you adopt a different persona and that's fun for you okay so um what's common in the ancient past is for people to adopt different social structures and they can choose what social structure to go to okay and certain certain communities still practice it today okay this is the wayfinders by Wayade Davis one of the best books I've ever written uh sorry I've I've ever read um he's he is looking at also print of communities native tribes throughout the world okay and he's looking at specifically the Amazon people if you go to the Amazon you'll have many different indigenous tribes okay so let's look at the religion and as you can and one one thing I will show you is that even though these people look simple like you know they wear the same clothes and their life looks very simple spiritually they're very complex people and they're very complex and sophisticated mythology okay so these are these called called people of the anacana okay in the beginning before the creation of seasons before the ancestral mother Romeo woman shaman opened her womb before her blood and breast milk gave rice rivers and her ribs to the mountain ridges of the world there was only chaos in the universe okay so they have this very complex mythology i'm not going to I'm not going to go through all of it okay but I will show you the picture of it this is a universe that they've created from themselves it is complete it's unified it's very complicated and that's true for all mythologies one thing that's really important for them is maintain balance and harmony in the world okay so like most printed people they believe there are different dimensions and their role is to maintain harmony across these dimensions because that that is what guaranteed a happy and prosperous life okay so let's read this together the people living today in the forest of the parapane which is the Amazon the entire natural world is saturated with meaning and cosmological significance every rock and waterfall embodies a story plants and animals are but distinct physical manifestations of the same essential spiritual essence okay so every plant every rock has a life force and they appreciate the diversity the complexity the sophification of different life forces okay so even though they can express themselves they don't have a written language their minds are extremely vibrant and dynamic and energetic at the same time effing is more than it appears for the visible world is only one level perception behind every tangible form every plant and animal is a shadow dimension a place invisible to ordinary people but visible to the shaman this is the realm of the hood spirits a world of diaphsores where rocks and rivers are alive plants and animals are human beings sap and blood the bodily fluids of the primordic river of the anacona hidden in cataracts behind the physical veil of waterfalls in the very center of stones are the great moleculus of the hus where everything is beautiful the shining feathers the cocoa the calabash of tobacco powdered which is itself the skull and brain of the sun okay you can see how the mythology is very complex and how they imbued it embedded into their everyday life every day when they wake up and they see the world they see a world of color of energy of change okay all right he continues "Among the Barasana such renewal is the fundamental obligation of the living in practice this implies the Braz see the earth as potent the forest as being alive with spiritual beings and ancestral powers to live off the land is to embrace both its creative and destructive potential human beings plants and animals share the same cosmic origins in a profound sense are seen as essentially identical responsive to the same principles oblate by the same duties responsible for the collective well-being of creation there's no separation between nature and culture without the forest and rivers humans would perish but without people the natural world would have no order or meaning all would be chaos thus the norms that drive social behavior also define the manner in which human beings interact with the wild the plants and animals the multiple phenomenon of the natural world lightning and thunder the sun and the moon the scent of a blossom the so sour order of death everything is related everything connected a single integrated whole mythology infuses land and life with meaning encoding expectations and behaviors essential to survival in the forest anchoring each community each malaka to a profound spirit of place okay so you can see how sophisticated their imagination is okay so one thing that um I discuss continuously because it's very important concept is how effing is a harmonious whole and so when you kill something you first need permission you need you need have a contract okay this is true through most of human history so these people are no different when mango forest to hunt or fish it is never a trivial passage first a shaman must travel in trans to negotiate while the master with the masters of the animals forging a mystical contract with the spirit guardians in exchange based always on reciprocity okay d reciprocity if you kill an animal you need permission now if you kill the animal you must thank the animal through through ritual sacrifice okay the basana compare it to marriage for hunting towards a form of courtship in which one seeks the blessings of a greater authority for the honor of taking into one's family a precious being meat is not the right of a hunter but a gift from the spirit world to kill without permission is to risk death by spirit guardian by it in the form of a jaguar anakona tapar or harpy eagle okay so the concept here is karma right if you do evil evil will come to you okay so it's important to maintain harmony all right and this is no different from the cave paintings okay so you go back way back to to the dawn of humanity we believe the same thing okay we believe that these animals came from the spirit world and that's why you paint it that's why you express art to thank the animals for coming from the spirit world to feed and nourish us and after we kill them then um we pray that they return to us okay and this goes back you know tens of thousands of years all right let's go to Africa so so we were in the Amazon now let's go to Africa and in Africa there's some some people call the force people okay this is a book by Colin Turbo who spent a few years with them and these are the pygmies they live in the forest and guess what even though the mythology is a bit different they have different names they have different structures it's still the same essence okay so let's let's go over um this is called Mullamo which is a mutual instrument that they use to communicate with the spirits of the forest okay all right so one thing that's really important for these peoples is the idea of ritual you are a member of the community if you participate in all their rituals if you believe in the mythologies if you honor their ancestors and the and their traditions okay if you're not if you refuse to honor their traditions then they will ostracize you or they might even kill you okay so um uh the pygmies are having a religious festival and Colin Turbo says this i was told however that everyone had to eat just as no adult male was allowed to sleep but had to sing while Malomo singing was in progress apparently one of the greatest crimes that Pygmy can commit if not the greatest is to be found asleep when the Malobo is singing okay if you refuse to participate in the ritual or if you break the seriousness of of the ritual then you are a threat to community and they will kill you and they will forget about you okay so the if so once they kill you the woman would be told that the malommo itself the great animal of the forest had carried off one of their number but like the men they would ask no questions and would never again mention the missing men so if you disrespect them they would not only kill you but they would forget about you forever so this is how they explain why they do what they do why do they practice these rituals why these rituals such an important part of their lives normally everything goes well in our world but at night when we are sleeping sometimes things go wrong because we are not awake to stop them from going wrong army ants invade the camp leopards may come in and steal a hunting dog or even a child if we were awake these things would not happen so when something big goes wrong like illness or bad hunting or death it must be because the forest is sleeping and not looking after its children so what do we do we wake it up we wake it up by singing to it and we do this because we want it to awaken happy and everything will be well and good again so when our world is going well then also we sing the force because we wanted to share our happiness okay so their idea of God is heaven on earth where you're connected to the environment around you everything that you do impacts the environment the envir environment also impacts you as well so you practice these rituals in order to maintain balance and harmony in the world okay the world is a script living in living you must follow certain practices in order to respect the traditions of the world and that's what brings harmony and heaven to the world and this something that we've for most of our history something that we've understood and we've appreciated then the question then is what do we change okay and we'll we'll be discussing this as the semester progresses okay so that's it there questions before we end uh yeah uh so before you said that people nowadays Okay so so first of all I I I totally agree that people nowadays are lack of vision and imaginations you know contrast to people back in the days uh because of you know multiple reasons and so my question is that I I I agree that people nowadays are lack of vision but I kind of are a little bit confused about what your argument your argument that we cannot rebuild the pyramid because well from my point of view um nowadays we have the ability to you know build skyscrapers or metropolitans and so why what what is the factor that kind of stops we us to to build you know structures like a pyramid um okay so the question is what why can't we build the pyramids okay all right so there are different factors in place the first is um the resources that are required to build the pyramids it is tremendous okay okay so um to give you an example the stone that um sorry let me just bring this up okay the stone that they used to build the pyramids is enough to build a wall around France okay so this the size okay is beyond our imagination okay that's number one okay where we where we find the resource to do this second is the question of will why would why would we want to do this like do you want to rebuild the pyramids like okay well yeah that's another problem okay the third problem is organization which is um how would we organize the people in a way as to build the pyramids because back then it was a massive undertaking but again people were united by a a similar vision which is like we're bringing heaven to earth once we build the pyramids the gods can rest in peace the gods can come down and shine a divine light all over us so that's the end of history we're done okay just do just work hard for 20 years and then there'll be heaven on earth okay that's what drove them what inspires people today there's nothing there's nothing that inspires people today okay like oh make a billion dollars make a trillion dollars okay that's what inspires people but you know what to make a billion dollars it doesn't mean you have to work hard it just means you have to cheat and lie and steal okay so so does that make sense yeah it makes sense but u well nowadays we we people still have religions right let's say Christian is still one of the most powerful religions and uh people share and so are are they capable to you know build another very tremendous or imaginary structure or buildings okay okay so um this is hard okay for you to understand it means it's a different world and the brains work differently back in this age religion was the end all be all okay you live for your religion okay does that make sense today our religion is capitalism okay so and capitalism is just make as much money as you possibly hand and the the difference is back during the time of the Egyptians it was a spiritual age okay so you sought inspiration from the heavens and people's imaginations could expand because um they would wake up with ideas okay today we live in a materialistic age which is say we don't believe in God we don't believe in divinity we just believe in numbers in computers in process okay does that does that make sense to you okay it it's hard to understand because you live in a time of complete materialism so you don't understand what it means to live a life of spirituality of divinity of trying to bring heaven to earth okay but if you did do that then you'd be a very different person there were there were things that you could do that would be unimaginable to you okay for example if you go visit a temple or a monk they could meditate for months and months and months they could walk barefoot in the cold for years and years and years we can't do that okay because the moment I say "Hey meditate for a whole month just don't eat you can't do that." And you're like "What's the point?" And then their answer is because I want to be with God okay because I want to feel as though it's heaven on earth so it's not just a question of how smart you are it's a question of faith and purpose and meaning as well the the reality is that not only do we live a life of purpose and meaning and spirit we also think these things don't matter okay does that make sense all right any more questions yep um so so I I do agree that we cannot be permissed nowadays and and I'll definitely die if you just put me on a pathetic but uh so but like for more for more more than people we also can do like a lot of things that previous people cannot so so how does the the the building of a pyramid these things demonstrate that the py the the previous people are smart can you tell me what we do today that is so wonderful and spectacular what what what yeah what what do we do today that's so wonderful and spectacular and and you think is amazing what what give an example of something that we do today that is spectacular and wonderful um Okay yeah i mean give you an example okay okay well thank you okay yeah so give an example any any more questions does it matter for the first person who have the vision to build it and the second person have the same vision or it doesn't really matter they just build they just want to bring heaven to earth look that's a great question okay and this is hard for us to understand but there's no sense of individual proparity okay okay it's like this is my idea you can't have it okay it's it's always like we're in this together okay we don't know who built the pyramids why because it doesn't matter who built the pyramids all that matter is it was built that's the spirit that they had nowadays like if I have this idea how do I patent it how do I get credit for it how do I make money out of it okay and that's why ideas suck back then it was just like it doesn't what what matter what my idea is what matters is this idea is expressed to other people okay when you have that spirit when you have that heart when you are when you share who you are then God comes into you and gives you ideas you understand but if you're like "Nope all I want to do is make money." God leaves you okay and and that's hard for us to understand that's so back then there must have been a genius a charismatic leader and God gave him this vi not God but like the spirit world okay the universe gave him this vision for the pyramids and he knew exactly how to do it and then he goes to the pharaoh and says "Listen I have this vision." The pharaoh says "Let's just do it." Okay so the pharaoh got credit but it didn't matter who got credit it just doesn't matter what mattered is it was built do you understand there's no sense of individualism there's no sense of capitalism there's no sense of like private property it's all like let's just make let's just work together to build a better world okay and yes the people who worked on it were getting paid but that was that's not what mattered to them what mattered was achieving this vision together okay so it's hard for us to understand but once you have this mentality of common sacrifice you are able to do tremendous things together okay and I'm sorry but I can't think of an example of things that we do wonderful today like chatbt give me a break okay all right any more questions all right great so I'll see you guys next week okay
