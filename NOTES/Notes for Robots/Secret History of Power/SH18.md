so um we've done the Greeks and we've done the Israelites and today we discuss the Persians and today I introduce to you the most influential person who who has ever lived and his name is Zorathustra okay and Zorustra will create the world's first uh great religion world religion called Zorashinism and this will lead to the rise of the world's first great empire called the Persian Aid Empire okay so to understand uh Zorusta let's go back and understand how we humans have traditionally understood the world okay so intuitively we've understood that the world is one of consciousness okay the universe is conscious it's constantly vibrating okay these vibrations are infinite and the lower that the vibrations go the slower they are and therefore they give rise to matter okay and that gives rise to uh humans so we both inhabit the material universe but our minds inhabit the spiritual universe and um as a result when we vibrate as well our consciousness returns to to the universe okay so we're in constant dialogue with the universe now this is hard to understand so we've used metaphors or stories to explain this uh system all right so let's go over how uh we've we've explained the system using metaphors so this is God okay the god is called the monad or the one or noose but there are different names for this God and this God is perfect the problem with perfection is that you lack imagination you lack creativity and that's why when God emanates he created us okay humans why because we are material we have bodies and therefore we are imperfect what this means is that when we hit a wall we feel pain we can fall down we can die um we can suffer we can make mistakes at the same time it is through constantly making mistakes disobedience fallibility that we are able to be creative okay and as a result both God and we are in the process of becoming okay we are becoming into perfection we are be we are becoming into eternity and infinity and so we are co-creators with God now there are certain characteristics about the system um that you have to remember okay first of all in the system we need to have free will because only by having complete freedom can we be truly creative the monatic is controlling us then um there can't be any creativity it's it's all intentional it's all planned okay so free will is very important another very very important idea is the individual okay so what so how the system works is what matters is what happens inside of us okay because only us individually can give rise to creativity and so it is our interactions with the monad that's important okay another way of saying this is that use a metaphor okay the metaphor is a candle a candle sorry this is a bad drawing okay candle and we are all mirrors surrounding this candle and we are all candle is reflected in us okay so the monad is in us and um we are all part of together so what happens is what happens to us individually okay another very important part of this is it's eternity okay reincarnation the idea here is that when you die you just don't disappear your consciousness returns to the spirit world why because maybe in this world you made a lot of mistakes and because you made a lot of mistakes you can't really appreciate all the pain you've caused so when you return to spirit world then it's a time for you to reflect and understand your significance on this world okay and so the idea is that if you done a lot of good in this world if you've been virtuous you ascend to a higher plane and if you did a lot of bad things then you stay in the lower realm okay and this idea of heaven and hell why because if you did a lot of good first of all you can appreciate all that all that you've done you can be closer to the moon at okay if you've done a lot of bad then you will see for yourself all that that the hurt you've caused in the world okay and you be you'll be further down from the monad so this is how intuitively we've understood the universe to work okay when we're born we're b we're born almost with an intuitive understanding of this okay the problem is that as our populations continue to grow and grow eventually we have war okay and war gives rise to uh patriarchy and property why because how do you incentivize people to go fight well you promise them this wife will be yours okay you'll be the master of the household and whatever you win whether it's gold or whatever it will be yours forever okay and so these three things war patriarchy and property are all interlin together okay and this you can argue gives rise to the idea of capital remember when we last discussed the bronze age the bronze age was the height of capital and therefore it was the height of war slavery corruption okay violence evil in this world and in this time there will emerge prophets the port prophets who come and tell us that what we're doing is wrong and we must remember who we came from originally okay we must remember that we are part of the monad and that we're here to celebrate life not to destroy life to be creative not to be destructive to love not to make war okay and so um during the bronze age emerges a man named Zorathustra and he is a port prophet just like Homer and the Yahweh is um and he's dealing with a situation okay we've enter a system where war patriarch and property are prevalent and we can't imagine a world without these things so now he has to create a new system he has he has to present for his poetry new ideas that help us return to the monad okay and so he creates the beginnings of a new world religion called uh zurashinism okay so let's go over the basic ideas so remember that this is a polytheistic world where you fight for your god and the gods don't really care about what's good and what's evil all they care about is themselves so you celebrate them you make sacrifices to them if you give them enough money if you bought them well enough then you win wars okay so that's a system that is that we call polytheism so what um Azora Master does is that he reimagines system and creates a new hierarchy where a haram master is the top god okay and you can call him a monad as well and for for Zor Zor Thusra Aurora Master is the lord of wisdom okay it literally translate into lord of wisdom and he's represented by the idea of fire okay so what is astronism in Chinese it's right okay the religion of white fire it's a religion of wisdom and what then he also says is that the war of heaven and hell is within us okay and there are two forces that tear at us that divide us okay the first is a force of asha the second is the force of okay these ideas are hard to translate but asha just means truth and douch means the lie okay so the Greeks um really admire the Persians and what and what they said about the Persians is the Persians are good at three things they're good at um horse riding they're good at archery they're good at telling the truth the Persians find it abhorrent hateful to lie so they're always telling the truth okay uh but that's a very simplistic understanding of the system telling the truth is not what Asha is right um what Asha really is is a system of virtue by being virtuous by doing good in the world you become closer to a master you become his representative on earth so um to better understand this idea all right I'm going to introduce to you um another concept called the categorical imperative okay so Emanuel Kant so we don't know when Zor Zoro uh Zorathusa lived okay but he lived about 3,000 years ago emil Kant um is the 18th century okay so he's closer to our time and he introduces a concept called the categorical imperative for him the categorical imperative is the highest moral law the highest moral good what we all should strive to and what I will show you is that it's very similar to the concept of asha so there are three um principles of the category imperative the first the most important is the law of universality and what this idea states is that what is good well to know what is good imagine this imagine that whatever you do whatever you say everyone in the world will immediately do as well okay so if you get angry everyone gets angry at the same time if you are violent everyone everyone's violent at the same time okay if you curse God everyone curses God do you want to live in a world like that obviously not okay so that is what the categorical imperative is act and do and think as though everything you do will be reflected throughout the universe and you are the universe itself okay now um this idea has been misunderstood as uh the golden law right or do onto others as others would do unto you but actually no it's it's a much higher concept the higher concept is that imagine that you are God yourself okay and you everything you do will be reflected throughout the universe then how would you behave well you would behave with the highest virtue okay because you want to make the world a better place because if you do bad things people are going to do bad things to you okay so that's the first idea it's very important idea second idea um is free will so whatever you do cannot be coerced okay whatever you do must be out of your own desire your own will your own valition your own choice otherwise it's wrong okay so I cannot make you do good you only want to do good by yourself if you want to do evil you should do evil because it's your choice okay even though it leads to a worse world it's important to maintain the principle of free will and free choice okay now last is the idea of humans as the end now you have heard maybe heard the phrase the means to an end right so um maybe I'm a king and I need to build a better world so I need to start wars conquer the world so I need to sacrifice a billion human beings in order to create a perfect world right that may sound good in theory but what Kant and Zorustra would say is that's wrong because humans are the end onto themselves every life every human life is as valuable as all human life together okay you cannot sacrifice one person for the sake of the others that is fundamentally wrong do never do that that can only lead you into hell okay so these three things together gives us a concept of Asha you can see or you can see immediately how complicated it is but at the same time you can also understand how revolutionary it is okay because now Asha presents to us three new concepts that will revolutionize human history they are the individual what matters is what matters inside of you okay everyone's doing bad that's their problem don't worry about them just do what is good to you okay what is good for you the second is free choice don't ever feel as though you're being forced to do something do something because you will it so okay and then last is truth why do you do this because the monad will know okay because a horiz master will know because you will know okay so what your family says what your community says what your nation says does not matter only what you feel in your heart matters okay and let's introduce a new concept in human history called montheism and guess what guys zoroism will give birth to three new religions okay judaism Christianity and Islam right and this together is two to three point billion people on earth and that's why I say Zorra Thusra is the most important individual who's ever lived because he will create the structure for montheism okay these three concepts that will give rise to three world religions all right okay so something else I want you to understand is that Zor thus had a major impact on the Greeks um especially Greek philosophy in fact the Greeks didn't consider him just a poet they considered him the first scientist the first uh astronomer the first um um philosopher the first magician okay the Greek is reverence for him um and Plato will take a lot of his ideas and create a very powerful metaphor that helps us understand Asher better okay it calls it the allegory of the cave so imagine this imagine that we are in a cave okay we're all prisoners inside a cave we are chained to the ground okay so we can't ever get up we can't even move our necks we only stare at the wall in front of us now behind us is a fire and this fire is projecting shadows onto the wall okay and we give names to these shadows and this is what we call reality okay but it's a shadow reality it's all fake it's all false it's all what we imagine it to be one day for whatever reason one of us the chains disappear and so we stumble upwards out of the cave okay and now we're suddenly in the light right we see the sun the sun of course is Asha truth okay or a haram master and we're blinded because our eyes are used to seeing the dark right we can't see we feel nothing but pain for a long long time but over time we start to see more clearly and we see the world is beautiful okay we see the birds flying in the sky we see the trees around us we see the animals and we're like "This is beautiful." Okay i found heaven i found the truth i found Asha i have found a haram master this is what life is really about okay but over so but after some time you're like but this is not enough okay i have found the truth but the truth is not complete because I know there are my friends my family that are stuck inside the cave therefore for me to fully achieve Asha I must go down and tell them the truth tell them there is an asha and we can all break through our chains escape into the light and see the truth for ourselves and then we will be truly happy and free and wise okay that's what ashra is asha is not just breaking through your chains and seeing the truth for yourself but it's a responsibility to go and spread this virtue to everyone around you if you see injustice speak out m okay another way of saying this is let's use a metaphor a choir okay singing choir how's a choir work well our master the monad he's singing a song we have to sing along with him okay if we do that the world is harmonized the world is perfect the world is per is beautiful but if most of us are out of tune then we need to get into tune right okay So that's what Asha is asha is not just selfindalization self-truth it is helping others see the truth for themselves okay so if you yourself see the truth you now have responsibility to teach this truth to others but the problem is of course if you go down and tell everyone hey man this world we're living in is a shadow world it's a prison we need to break our chains and escape into the real world everyone's like "You're crazy man." Right get out of here man you're crazy and they're like "No no no no we have to go." And they're like "Okay well then describe this world to us." And you're like "Um it's hard it's kind of hard to describe." Well you're crazy then okay all right so that's Plato's allego the cave all right and this gives you a better understanding of um the idea of Asha okay so if you move towards the truth you're moving towards Asha but if you're moving away from Asha you're moving towards the Drew okay all right so that's a basic premise of um Zorashinism this is the idea that uh Zorus brought to the world and will forever change the world okay we'll go into the specific history next week but first what I want to do this week is just go into his ideas okay all right all right so Zorathusa we don't know when he lived okay but we estimate anywhere between the year 2000 B.CE to about a th000 BC that's a bronze age right i suspect he he lived towards the end of the bronze age why because when the bronze age is coming into the form people are in love with capitalism people want to get rich right but after the system matures there's slavery there's debt there's corruption there's misery there's suffering and so people want to hear another voice zor Thusa himself was a priest and it was disgusted by the corruption of priest because remember being a priest means being a teacher leading people into the light leading people into Asha but once uh the branches becomes more mature then priests are corrupt they uh want a lot of money for helping you achieve immortality um they sort of spread false teachings okay become very corrupt and so uh Zorusta becomes disgusted and he wanders around spreading his new message of Asha okay now um what's important to understand is that we don't know where Zorusa worked specifically but we suspect northern Iran okay why is this important because during the branch age um the main centers of wealth were Mesopotamia Egypt the Levant so this is more like a colony where there's a lot of mining going on okay so what's going on here is basically the most human suffering in the world okay so imagine maybe Congo where they're using they're using um child slaves to dig for rare earths okay it's it it's a margin empire where war is a very common thing violence is very common thing people are being kidnapped and forced to work in the minds in order to get tin for the branch age economy okay all right so as you can see um Zorusa is about here okay either northeast Iran or northwest uh Iran okay and as and as I mentioned the global economy is around here okay this is where most most of the wealth is these people are poor they're enslaved and they're extremely violent okay all right so Zorusa comes and he's a poet prophet okay he's a priest and he's singing songs to help people better understand the world around them he's trying to remind them of who they are really okay they really are parts of God all right so he says "Listen with your own ears with a bright mind choose truth from false creed each person for his own self before the final judgment comes." Okay so the idea of in the individual what matters is yourself what you do what your family does what your clan does what your tribe does not matter what you do because when you die you will face a masta the final judgment okay not your family but you yourself and so what you must do is choose asha the truth okay what is the truth being virtuous because you yourself are virtue okay um so um he wrote in a language called Avasten and it's a beautiful language and if you are a Zoroastrian priest you can memorize all this okay but I am not and I don't want to butcher the language okay but it's poetry it's beautiful right so ash is the best of all that is good and ash is happiness happiness belongs to the one who follows the righteous path for the sake of the best righteousness so how do you know you're doing asha because you are happy okay do you understand so the metaphor is imagine that you live in a world of like fat people who don't exercise and all they do is watch TV right and but you decide to go and work out and you become more fit how do you know you're on the right path because you feel happier about yourself okay but the problem of course is that you lose all your friends you lose all your family okay that's why people don't do this not because um they don't know the truth is because they fear the truth all right so so this is some trusted poetry called agathas that we know that Jorah thus wrote okay or he didn't write it they were all illiterate at this point but he sang it okay now the two primal spirits who reveal themselves in vision as twins are the better and the bad in thought and word and action and between these two the wise ones choose all right the foolish one not so okay so we in our nature always um divide into into two halves okay the good and the bad the asha and the douch and to be truly virtuous it has to be good thoughts um good words and good actions okay you have to be unified as a person you can't speak the truth but then do bad things okay you have to think good thoughts speak good thoughts and do good works and that's what um Zarashinism okay and when these twain spirits came together in the beginning they created life and not life and that at the last worst existence shall be the followers of the lie but the best existence to him that follows right of these two twin spirits he that followed the life the lie choose doing the worst things the holiest spirit choose right he that clothe him with a massy heavens as a garment so likewise they that are fain to please aaram master by beautiful actions between these twin the Davas okay those that lead you to the Drewge also chose not a right for infatuation came upon them as they took counsel together so that they chose the worst thought then they rushed together to violence that they might infeas by demons who choose violence to control us okay and and what do you do and to him came dominion and good mind and right and piety gave continued life to their bodies and indestructibility so that by they retributions through metal he may gain the prize over the others even in a world of evil you can choose and you must choose to be good all right if people are lying you tell the truth because what matters is your individual action not what others are doing so when there cometh their punishment for their sins then oh master at thy command shall good thought establish the dominion in a consump consummation for those who deliver the lie or harara into the hands of right okay so God will know what what good you did what evil you did okay when you die it'll be the final judgment you will have to face God so we may be those that make this world advance oh master Master and you order come hither thou shaving a mission into your company and Asha in order that our thought may gather together while reason is still shaky okay so even though the world has turned evil even though the people the elite are evil you can still do good and God will know you do good and God will reward you for doing good okay so again this is the beginning of monotheism and as you can see this idea will echo in Christianity and Islam as well then truly on the world of lie shall come the destruction of the light but they who get themselves good name shall be partakers in the promised reward in the fair abol of good thought of master and of right oh if oh ye mortals ye mark those commandments which master have ordained of happiness and pain the long punishment for the follower of the drew and blessings for the followers of the right then hereafter shall it be well okay so you should do what is virtuous not only because God uh will reward you for doing so but because you will feel eternal happiness in doing so when though amass in the beginning did create the individual and individuality through thy spirit and powers of understanding when though did make life clothed with a body when actions and teachings whereby one may exercise one's convictions at once free okay so you see individual free will these are the core concepts here okay never say you're being coerced you always have the choice you always have the choice to resist then lifts up his voice the false speaker or the true speaker he that knows or he that knows not each according to his own heart and mind passing from one to another ar matei confers with a spirit in whom there is wavering okay clear it is to the man of understanding as one who has realized it with thought he upholds Asha together with good dominion by his word and deed he will be oh master the most helpful helper to thee okay so when we choose to follow Asha we are doing God's work when we in our hearts choose Asha we at the at that moment change the world for the better okay all right so this sounds a bit complicated a bit abstract and honestly he was speaking to people at that time okay so what does he really really mean and how can we understand what he's really saying well the argument I want I I I want to make you today is that all part prophets are the same they're all divinely inspired they're all speaking a certain truth so by understanding other part prophets of that region of that culture we gain insight into the true thinking of Zoro okay so this is Roomie who is considered the greatest Persian poet who has ever lived he lived in the 13th century which is about 2,000 years 3,000 years after Zorathustra in many ways if you actually read his poetry he is the reincarnation of Zorathustra okay so we're going to read a bit of his poetry and then once you read his poetry they'll give you insight into the cosmology of Zorashinism all right i see so deeply with myself i so see deeply with myself not needing my eyes i can see everything clearly why would I want to bother my eyes again now that I see the world through his eyes his eyes okay through the eyes of Asha through the eyes of the Monad through our master okay that's what how you should be seeing okay in other words you should be seeing the world through your imagination you can imagine a better world if you imagine a better world you can create a better world so don't be fooled by the material world around us it's all fake it's all an illusion not Christian or Jew or Muslim not Hindu Buddhist Sufi or Zen not any religion or cultural system i'm not from the east or the west not out of the ocean or up from the ground not natural or ether not compulsive elements at all i do not exist i'm not an an entity in this world or in the next do not descend from Adam and Eve or any origin story my place is placeless a trace of the traceless neither body or soul i belong to the beloved have seen the two worlds as one and that one called and no first last outer inner only that breath breathing human being okay does that make sense to you we're all part of God that's our true nature there's a divine spark in us don't be fooled by the material world okay and don't be fooled by labels christians Buddhists Jews there's no difference we're all the God children of God okay we're all the same so don't be fooled by labels okay so there's a joke okay the joke is this god and Satan are fighting over humanity and God says to Satan "Ha humans have discovered religion therefore I have won." And then Satan says "Yeah but then I'll just organize it." Okay so the idea is that religion is great okay okay I'm a big supporter of religion but organized religion is problematic because organized religion serves the interests of the priests who control the religion okay and that's why there are the differences in these religions in Buddhism in Judaism and Islam and Christianity because the people in charge need to differentiate the religion in order to um exploit you okay in order to justify their existence but at the end of the day we're all connected to the vine and all that matters is our connection okay so all these uh differences is something that is artificially created to fool us all right all that I think about it then I say it where did I come from and what am I supposed to be doing okay i have no idea my soul is from elsewhere i'm sure of that and I intend to end up there okay i don't remember where I came from but I know that I must have come from somewhere okay this began in some other realm some other tavern when I get back around to that place I'll be completely sober meanwhile I'm like a bird from another continent sitting in his Avery the day is coming when I fly off but who is it now in my ear who hears my voice who says word words within my mouth who looks out with my eyes what is a soul I cannot stop asking if I could taste one of for an answer I could break out of this prison for drunks i didn't come here on my own accord i can't leave that way whoever brought me here will have to take me home okay this is beautiful and it's also a rewriting of the Plato of Plato's allegory of the cave right this is a prison for drunks here we're all drunk we're all blind from our true reality this is just a prison when we return to the Monad to Master then we'll see the truth for ourselves okay all right so here's another poor prophet Federick Nichi okay fred Nichi is one of the three great German philosophers of the past um 500 years um Emanuel Kant Frederick Hegel and Ferdick Nishi and Ferdick Nichi wrote does spoke Zorah and he wrote in a very interesting way he likes to take these long walks he can walk walk for like hours and hours in the mountains and then now and then he feels as though he's being seized okay a force has seized him and compels him to speak and he believes this person is Zoro okay so he wrote a book and it just is a recollection of all the moments when he was seized by Zorusta and forced to speak his words all right and we actually read what Nichi writes you will see that it's actually pretty similar to what Zorusa himself um promoted during his time of course Nichi is uh promoting it in a more modern contemporary lens okay so if Zoroa were to come back uh he would be he'll basically be Nichi okay so in many in many ways Nichi and Roomi are reincarnations of Zorustra they're all trying to speak a divine truth to humanity all right so this is the prologue the first page of the spec zorra okay and what you will notice okay look for this what you will notice is that this exactly like the atta was 30 years old he left his home in the lake of his home and went into the mountains there he enjoyed his spirit in a solitude and for 10 years did not wear of it but at last his heart changed and rising one morning of the rosy dawn he went before the sun and inspect thus onto it though great star what would thy happiness if thou had not those for whom thou shineest for 10 years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave though would have weather of thy light and of the journey had it not been for me mine eagle and my serpent but we awaited thee every morning took from thee thine overflow and bless thee for it lo I'mware of my wisdom like the bee that hath gathered too much honey i need hands outstretched to take it i would fain bestow and distribute until the wise have once more become joyous in the folly and the poor happy in their riches therefore my I I descend into the deep as though does in the evening when though go behind the sea and give light also to the neither world though exuberant star like thee must I go down as men say to whom I shall descend okay so Zorusta has hid himself in a cave and in inside the cave in solitude he has discovered Asha he has discovered the secrets of the universe and he's discovered that this is not enough i must now go shine the light on everyone otherwise I can never achieve a fully okay so it's exactly like the other girl in the cave where the prisoner he escapes into the light and he's happy until he realizes that you can't be happy alone you have to share this happiness with everyone else okay so it's exactly like the algorith all right let's continue though in Plantus thy highest aim to the heart of those passions then became thy virtues and joys and though were of the race of the hot-tempered or the volutuous or the fanatical or the vindictive all thy passions in the end become virtues and all thy devils angels once had those while dogs in thy cellar but they change at last into birds and charming songstresses out of thy poisons breed though balsom for them for thyself thy cow affliction milk so th though drinkkeeth though the sweet milk of her other and nothing evil grow in thee any longer unless it be the evil that grow out of the conflict of thy virtues my brother if thou be fortunate then will thou have one virtue and no more thus goes no easier over the bridge illustrious is to have many virtues but a hard lodge and many of one have gone into the wilderness and killed himself because he wasware of being the battle and battlefield of virtues okay question then is if our master is wisdom why do we live in a world of hate of evil of sin and the answer is because virtue must come from vice good can only come from evil okay to live in good forever is to live in ignorance okay we are born in the drew so that we we may discover Asha from our struggles we will discover what truly good is and that's a gift that God has given us to grow to live in a time of evil so that we may ourselves may create good for humanity okay that's the central message of of this without vice there can be no virtue and to have one virtue itself is not enough you must be constantly in a battle to create more and more virtue okay so if you are a man of sin or a woman of evil be thankful because now is your opportunity to be a star a a son that through transformation of oneself can can brighten the world okay and when you do that you transform the world and then when you after you do that your next battle is to go and transform someone else or to look deeper and discover the evil in you okay so don't worry about the world itself just worry about you yourself because within yourself is a universe of evil that can be transformed into a universe of good so um one really important thing I I I have to say is that this is not Buddhism okay the the structure and the framework are very similar but what Zoro Zor ainism fundamentally says is that compassion is not enough okay you have to act because justice is about action if you see injustice you must speak out you can't be like "Oh um inde I'm indifferent because I'm compassionate." Okay that's not enough you have to act out and that's why uh people who believed in this religion were so creative okay because they believe in action being indifferent is simply being is basically being complicit in the system right all right ye tell me life is hard to bear but for what purpose shall you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening life is hard to bear but not affect to be so delicate we are all of us find some asses and she assasses okay what we have in common with a rose bud which trembleth because a drop of dew have formed upon it it is true that we love life not because we are want to live but because we are want to love love is Asha right um we want always want to achieve asha there's always some madness in love but there's always also some method in madness and to me also who appreciate life the butterflies and soap bubbles and whatever is like them amongst us seem most to enjoy happiness to see those light foolish pretty liely little sprites flit about that move Zasa through tears and songs i should only believe in a god that would know how to dance and when I saw my devil I found him serious thorough profound and solemn he was a spirit of gravity through him all things fell okay so what Nishi hates is organized religion because organized religion it is very serious very somber he basically wants to enslave us right it's like don't do anything bad don't drink don't smoke don't have sex or you'll burn in hell okay that's very serious and what Zurusta and what Nisha is saying is that that's not what Asha is man ashes recognized that the world is beautiful that our master is all merciful all forgiving all love all compassion and you must delight in the world because that's why he created us okay so the only way to survive this world of evil is to recognize that beauty is everywhere around us and there's our responsibility to discover this beauty and celebrate this beauty okay dance sing make love laugh smile that's what life is about okay if a priest is telling you hey uh meditate for your life because only through that will you avoid sin he's a devil man okay because he's denying you your free will he's denying you your capacity to love to seek action yourself okay but one day will the solitude worry thee one day will thy pride yield and thy courage quail though one day cry I'm alone one day will thou see no longer thy loftiness and see too closely thy loneliness thus eliminate itself or frighten thee as a phantom thou will one day cry all false so life is a constant struggle okay between hope and tragedy um there are some days when you will be very hopeful but there are some days when you'll be very depressed that's just the process of life and that's the process of wisdom okay to seek wisdom you always have to constantly destroy yourself you have to destroy the world around you and and it's a never- ending process of pain and suffering and tragedy but it will gradually lead you to enlightenment what's really important is to act okay to seek self-destruction so another way of saying this is always assume that whatever you know no matter how truthful is probably wrong and to go and negate yourself okay it also means leaving your family leaving your comfort zone all right a heretic will thou be to thyself okay a heretic is someone who doubts yourself right saying everything I've known is wrong okay so another way of saying this and I I know it's hard to understand is you come to my class for a semester and everything I teach you you're like "Wow this makes a lot of sense." Okay and every day you're excited you learn a lot but at the end of semester what you want to say is everything I've learned this semester is wrong so I'm going to learn for myself i'm going to get I'm I'm going to negate everything I've learned and believe everything I've learned is deceitful so that I can rebuild my own knowledge and through that process will you actually achieve enlightenment okay the truth is it has to be to you there can be no truth for everyone the truth has to be for you and you must fight for it every day okay ready must thou be to burn thyself in thy own flame okay you must destroy yourself how could thou become new if thou have not first become ashes do you understand to live is to die if you really want to understand you must first destroy every everything that that you think you understand in order to build a new understanding though lonesome one though go the way of the creating one a god will thou create for thyself out of the seven de devils though lonesome one though goes the way of the loving one though loves thyself and on account despise thyself as only the loving one despise to create desire the loving one become because he despised what know he of love who have not been obliged to despise just what he loved okay this is a really hard con to understand but like you know in the Buddhist tradition it's like avoid anger no no no embrace your anger embrace your hate because hate and love go together anger and calm go together okay so by going to one extreme you can now embrace the other extreme and your life is a constant struggle between these two different extremes when you negate yourself when you move into nothingness you can only move into ignorance and slavery okay does that make sense you are born of two natures you must let these two natures fight okay all right when Zorusa had spoken these words he paused like one who had not said his last word and long balance the staff undouily in his hand at least he spoke thus and his voice had changed i now go alone my my disciples ye also now go away and alone so will I have it verily I advise you depart from me and guard yourselves against Zorustra and better still be ashamed of him perhaps he have deceived you the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also hate his friends okay you want true knowledge you can learn from me but at the end we must leave each other and you must say he's now my enemy i must now destroy him if I really want to be myself I need to destroy my teachers in order to discover my true self okay and as you can imagine most people don't want to do this most people just want to cling to their mother want to cling to the teacher but you can never achieve true asha if you do this okay ye love your virtue as a mother love her child but when did one hear of a mother want to be paid for her love it is your dearest self your virtue the ring's thirst is in you to reach itself again struggle every ring and turn itself and like the star that go out so is every work of your virtue ever is is its light on its way and traveling and when will it cease to be on its way thus is the light of your virtue still on its way even when its work is done be forgotten and dead still its ray of light live and travel okay so when we die our bodies decompose what's still left is our virtue okay that's who we are our virtue all that good we've done in the world all the knowledge all the enlightenment all the emotions that we've generated okay that will be eternal and so we must embrace this nature and become virtue itself okay being human is to be first and foremost virtuous to seek Asha for this is the truth i've departed from the house of the scholars and the door have I also slammed behind me too long did my soul sit hungry at their table not like them have I got the knack of investigating as a knack of nutcracking freedom do I love in the air over fresh soil rather would I sleep on oxkins than on their honors indignities i am too hot and scorched with thine own thought often is it ready to take away my breath then have I go then I then I have I to go into the open air and away from all dusty rooms but they sit cool in the cool shade they want everything to be merely spectators and they avoid sitting where the sun burn on the steps like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers by thus do they also wait and gape at the thoughts which others have thought okay so this is a radical idea but it's very true you go to university not to learn how to think but to fall into ignorance okay why because the professors there the priests there they have departed from reality and they've chosen to live a life of comfort of ease of pleasure and as a result they can't know anything true knowledge is can only be found in the everyday in the mundane with ordinary people that's where God is okay universe are constructed to be away from God they are temples for the comfort of priest so if you want true knowledge go out into the world and talk to another people suffer okay all right so that's it okay so now you you can understand the beauty and power of Zorusta and and I I really do believe this i really believe that Nishi was channeling Zorusta but he was channeling in a way for the common mind okay because the thing about Asha is that it's always changing all right the Asha that was true 3,000 years ago is not the Asha that's true for us today all right and what's really important to understand is that Asha is constantly coming so you have to constantly work towards it there's no there's no end point to Asha all right and Asha is going to be different for everyone but if everyone's moving towards Asha then the world becomes a more virtuous a better place and a more just place okay so um any questions guys all right so um last class I gave a lecture on um the Bible and I made a mistake in my lecture so um in my my discussion about the story of the patriarchs um between the love story of Rachel and Jacob I said that uh Jacob had had to work seven years for Rachel after his marriage to uh Leah but as uh this substscriber um Cole tells me actually that's not what the Bible says the Bible says that um Laban the father gave Rachel to Jacob right away but then he had to work seven years to pay off that debt okay so uh thank you to Cole for correcting the error in fact I probably made a lot of small errors um in my uh talk last class and and I obviously made make a lot of mistakes every class okay so I apologize for that but the thing about this class and it's really important for us to remember is that this is a class not about answers it's about questions okay so what makes this class interesting and special is that we're always asking the hard questions what does it mean to be human where do we come from why are we here where are we going okay we're always asking these questions because these are questions that actually matter for us okay that's the first thing second thing is that I'm constantly in the process of becoming i'm constantly um trying to discover the answers and so for for me this is a journey so for example um Zorustra is a revelation to me before I didn't know about Zorusra and I made a lot of mistakes so for example I said that Christianity was the first monistic religion last um semester and now I recognize that's wrong it's actually zorashinism okay so I'm constantly in the process of discovery of becoming um and what's really important is that we continue to speculate we continue to explore together all right and if so if you don't like what I say this class or you don't like my opinion just wait a year or two and I'll probably change my opinion okay because that that's what true knowledge is about if you really want to pursue knowledge you must be willing to as Nichi as Zorusa says you constantly need to destroy yourself to burn yourself into ashes so that you may build yourself a new okay and that's what the process of um real education should be about okay so in this class I'm not here to give you a easy answers i'm not I'm not here to give you facts that you must memorize i'm here to ask you questions that help you better understand yourself and better understand the world around you to help this class is about conversation dialogue and debate okay all right so any questions guys yeah sorry give you the mic um so as to say uh ash is different for for different individuals um so I was thinking about an example is um so Hitler as a racist um he he he not only himself but he also making uh um some like a lot a lot a lot of people to hate jewels and let's assume that he um think jewels are evil in his heart and trying to destroy them so if he think that this is uh real justice does this still count for Ash okay look um look it's a very sensitive topic you know Hitler and the Holocaust i don't want to spend too much time on okay but if you truly understand Asha um if you truly understand Zoroa what it would say is that Ara Masta is complete forgiveness compassion and love okay so whatever we do on this in this world will be forgiven in the end i I I know I I I understand this is hard for a lot of people to accept um I I know that we grew up knowing that there must be evil in this world because of the Holocaust and there must be Satan and all that but um if you really want to discover Asha you have to let go of these ideas and understand that in the end all will be forgiven okay I'm sure that there are people you hate in this world and you think that they're they must burn in hell because of all the evil they they've done they've done in this world but if we want to appreciate Asha if we really want to discover the the truth okay we need to let go of this hatred we need to let go of um of of this judgment okay um I mean I mean the the very point of Asha is don't worry about other people just worry about yourself don't compare yourself to other people compare yourself to yourself okay and and so how do you know you're moving towards Asha because you can feel it all right the problem is what keeps us from Asha are two things our ego and our fear we want to be liked by everyone our ego okay our fear of rejection people of saying something that offends other people being politically correct okay like I know that in my class I offend a lot of people and I get shot at all the time on YouTube and I know that okay but if I want to achieve asha I need to take this risk okay because at the end of the day what matters is my own individual pursuit of the truth what others think of me does not matter okay so the problem our society is we're brainwashed into thinking that the opinions of others matter okay what what what your teacher says about you matters because the teachation will decide whether or not you get into good university how much money you make matters because that will give you status in society okay and what Zoro thusta what Nichi what room what Plato they're all saying is this it doesn't matter man what matters if you want true happiness if you want true enlightenment if you want uh asha you have to embark on a personal journey that requires solitude that requires rejecting everything that you know in the past so that you can rebuild yourself once you make that once you make that that decision action will come to you naturally okay but first and foremost what you need to do is let go of these prejudices let go of these ideas that have been put into you okay I know yes I I know I will get shouted out i I I I know get cursed online for saying you know Hitler will be forgiven but Hitler will be forgiven because everyone will be forgiven okay everyone will be forgiven okay okay there is no there is no hell i'm sorry i'm sorry to say this okay i'm sorry to say but there is no hell hell is what we create in our hearts okay everyone will be forgiven all right but but thank you for the question any any more questions okay uh my question would be um I know that Asha for everyone will have different but like will it change in a different period like when I was being as a child or when I grow up would that change um okay so like I I'm not a Zorashian priest and I I don't want to insult the religion okay because what they will tell you is that um at the end of the day Asher is virtue and God is virtue okay so so when you do asha you're moving towards God which is perfection okay but um I think that what Nichi would say and maybe thus but I think Nichi would definitely say this is that God is creativity okay So God so what you really want to do is when you move towards Asha is to constantly reinvent yourself to discover new ideas about yourself and this is a never- ending process okay there's no finale finale to it if there's no there's no finale to it that means that each of us uh will live our own individual lives that's different from from others okay and and so what this means is that Asha will become different for each of us but what's important is and Roomie would say this Evan would say this is follow your heart okay ignore what others think dissipate your fears okay kill your fears and just believe in yourself follow your heart and action will come naturally to you okay and when that happens also God will come naturally to you and you'll discover new truths uh new powers new understandings that will bring you greater happiness in life okay does that make sense okay great any more questions guys all right mean that we'll never Yeah so does that mean we'll never be like like uh not physically but like with Asha but like we're always trying to get closer with them okay yeah so again there's no end point okay there's no destination here okay it's becoming okay it's a pos constant process of becoming and it's not possible to seek Asha in one lifetime right that's why we are reincarnated because we come back and we do it over again and we move closer towards Asha each time but there can never be an end point okay because let's just say you reach that end point guess what everyone else hasn't so you have a duty now to help other people okay does that make sense so if you move closer to Asha you also want to move others closer to Asha so it's a constant it's a constant struggle but that's what gives meaning and purpose to the universe the fact that we're all striving to be better okay virtue truth asha these are all we strive for okay there can be no perfection there can just be only a process of becoming right does that make sense yes okay so look I mean I know people want simple answers i know that oh there'll be there'll be a final judgment we're going to go to heaven and we'll live every happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happ happy happily ever after okay that's not what that's not what the truth is the truth is that the universe is a constant process of becoming of struggle of pain of tragedy but from that we can build hope and virtue and good okay all right so thank you so I've done I've gone over into the three major civilizations Okay the Greeks uh the Israelites and the Persians that that have come after the collapse of the Bronze Age okay what what I'm going to do next week is I'm going to put I'm going to show you how these three civilizations interact with each other okay we're going to go into the history of these civilizations okay all right so I'll see you guys next
