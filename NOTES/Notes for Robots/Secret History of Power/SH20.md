good morning so um let us review what we learned last class and then we will discuss the Greeks today so um as I discussed last class there are three major principles to geopolitics and once you master an understanding of these three principles then um you will see the world much more clearly okay the first idea is that the competition uh within states is greater than the competition um between or among states okay and this is the idea of elite overp production so the historian uh Peter Turchin he looked at the fall of the Roman Republic the French Revolution he looked at many similar events in human history and he discovered that what drives crisis is the fact that you have too many elite competing for limited position of status and power okay and that's what drives a lot of conflict uh within the nation state another way of framing this is that um the conflict in states is not between rich and poor but between the have a lot and have some but what more okay so usually between the upper nobility and the lower nobility we see this throughout human history so next class we we will discuss the Rome okay we'll discuss that and we we understand that a lot of conflict was between the upper nobility and the lower nobility so Julius Caesar did what he did because he was all the lower nobility and was trying to reach the upper nobility okay so this is the first principle that you need to understand that what drives a lot of conflict is elite overproduction okay that's number one number two is the elite um has no loyalty okay this is really important principle to understand the elite don't have loyalty to their people or to their state or even to the families they will do whatever is necessary for them to accumulate power okay um and this idea of Game of Thrones right so I'm not sure if you've seen the television show or read the book series Game of Thrones but um the world is Game of Thrones and these people who love power they will kill their parents they will kill their brothers they will kill their own children in order to amass power from themselves okay so the game of thrones is a very nasty affair the third thing is that war is often about maintaining that status quo okay or the idea of equilibrium if you look at World War I tens of millions of people died okay and you cannot possibly understand what happened or you have problems explaining what happened because the military strategy in World War I was so idiotic right you just threw millions of people at each other but if you understood that war is really about maintaining the status quo that maybe you have access population of males and if you don't get rid of them then they will engage you in the revolution okay you understand that war is really about maintain the status quo then war one makes a lot more sense okay so these are three major ideas that I want you to understand and once you understand these three ideas it's a lot easier for you to understand the movement of history okay so we're so we will use an example from Chinese history so you have you have a clear understanding of how this works okay so let's talk about the waring states period this is something that hopefully you all know really well okay so during the waring states period you had lots of really powerful states okay you had the jou you had the way you had the chew okay and um at this point in history you could believe that any one of the three would become the empire they would unite the entire um middle kingdom because they had access to rivers so it's easy for them to transport soldiers and do goods they had a large population they were on fertile ground okay and then over here is this poor backward and isolated people called theQing and these were barbarians okay so how was it possible for theQing who are these barbarians not very advanced very poor limited population to eventually cover all of China okay well once you understand these three principles we can now explain it because what what's happening is that the jao the way and the true are pretty stable states okay and so the major problem is lead over production the conflict between the upper nobility and the lower nobility and the way that we resolve the issue is by waging war against each each other but waging war against each other not to conquer each other but in order to reduce the domestic conflict within their nation states and as such war became a ritual in which it was like a chess game okay the point was not to destroy each other the point was just to maintain equilibrium maintain a status quo and as a result these states became stable but another word for stable is stagnant and now what's happening is first of all theQing is being recruited into the wars because theQing is poor therefore they can provide mercenaries okay once they do that what happens is that these mercenaries learn all the innovations of the jou way and in terms of military strategy okay so you have this massive infusion of innovation into theqing all right so the ching is being energized we call this energy right innovation energy and ideas but not only that but you have talented people of the low nobility right they want to become officials they they want to become generals but there's opportunities for them so where do they go guys they go to the chain okay now you have people coming in as well and now what's happening is that theQing has this massive infusion of energy innovation talent and so now they can just bulldoze everyone okay and now you're like wait a minute here surely the ja the way the two recognize the danger of the ching and they will respond by uniting together and then destroy the ching okay that never happens why the reason why is that um once you enter an equilibrium you understand the world through this equilibrium so in their perspective the chain becomes stronger but that's okay because all we'll do is we'll just bribe them or we will have them become part of the system why would they want to take us over why can't we just live happily ever after okay so it is impossible for the jao the way of the chu to imagine that theqing would one day overtake them okay another another way of saying this is that once become once you reach an equilibrium the people inside the equilibrium become lazy stupid and arrogant okay and that's and that's why theqing is easily able to destroy all three together in fact the lower nobility in all three states probably supported the takeover right because now they have opportunities to rise within their societies okay and that's the pattern of human history and we see this over and over all right so now let's move on to the west okay yeah yeah so the equilibrium means that the war made the com like the status competition between within the countries more stable yeah equilibrium just means they've reach a balance point okay oh okay yeah and things are just staying the same oh okay and so people think that things will stay the same forever so they can't imagine change happening but the thing about human society is that things always change okay so remember the pattern of the warning states well guess what this repeats over and over so let's look at Mesopotamia so as we discussed about Mesopotamia you have the first city Uric and what they will do is that as they expand as a city they will develop colonies along the Tigris and Euphrates and then these become a waring states as well and as we discussed what will happen is over time they will reach an equilibrium basically a status quo or rules to make sure that the elite stay in power okay and one important rule that they have is we can we can go to war against each other but we cannot destroy each other's temple why because the temple is the house of your patron god if you kill the patron god then the god will be very angry and will kill all of you okay so this creates an equilibrium because where do they put all their gold and wealth the temple so you can go and conquer people but you can't touch their gold and their wealth and therefore you cannot expand okay so this creates the idea of equilibrium but as I discussed what happen is that um because of the equilibrium energy will flow into a poor exit area called uma and from uma where a merch named Lucazagi who's like you know what screw this system I'm going to go for it all okay so he dares destroy a temple and before this was unimaginable because if you destroy a temple the god's going to come in from heavens and destroy you right that didn't happen but now Lucas Aagi has destroyed the equilibrium and now he has access to wealth and so he's very quickly able to overwhelm the other city states at this time the other city states call for help from mercenaries the Aadians who will come and conquer the entire region okay and establish an empire called the Aadian Empire led by Sara but now that they are an empire they will now also reach an equilibrium and this talent will flow somewhere else to energize another region okay so now what will happen is that the Babylonians will come the the Assyrians will come eventually from the Zagos mountains a new people called the Persians remember the Persians have a religion called Zerass will come and conquer all this area and then they will expand outwards and conquer both Anatolia and Egypt okay and at this point in history now there's a new border area called the Greeks okay the Athenians Athens and Sparta and Athens and Sparta the Greeks encounter Persia because they will send in mercenaries to help Persia and these mercenaries will learn Persian war tactics and bring them back to Greece but not only that but with an empire the Greeks have an opportunity to get wealthy how through piracy right piracy and then this will force the Persians now to invade the Greek mainland to stop this piracy okay again this is a pattern throughout history the margins will get wealthy by committing piracy because why not right okay and so now the empire is forced to go invade um Greece and guess what they lose this is unimaginable how is that possible that some barbarians the Greeks are able to defeat a vast empire the world's largest empire the first great world empire called the Persians well this happens all the time okay why well the pattern is this okay so let's look at empire let's look at borderlands okay borderlands are just you know the barbarians all right the empire has three major advantages mass organization and death okay and what this means is that empire just is has a lot of people it has a centralized bureaucracy so the centraliz bureaucracy is is able to conscript these individuals and it doesn't matter if they lose a lot of battles they uh can keep on throwing soldiers at the enemy okay but the borderlands have three advantages that counteract these three other advantage okay and they are uh energy uh openness and cohesion okay meaning that the people work really hard they're not afraid to die they're open so they want to learn from other people and they are united as a people and this defeats an empire because the empire the people are not that energetic most of them are slaves actually um the empire is a bureaucracy so it's very stagnant it's very insular is close-minded and it's not and the empire is not united it's often divided okay that's why throughout human history the Borans are able to conquer the um empire okay so um okay so the Persians invade uh Greece they get c they get defeated and now Greece becomes the center of the world or part or major power okay so let's now discuss Greece okay so in Greece remember that we discussed Greece before and we we said that Greece becomes the center of innovation in the world because of three factors the first is Homer who is probably the greatest prophet puppet poet prophet in human history okay we read the Iliad together pet also wrote the Odyssey and these are the two founding texts of Greek civilization um the alphabet right they're now able to using alphabet write down all their thoughts and quickly transmit their thoughts throughout time and space the last of course is the polus okay the polus is their um system of government where all the citizens are involved in politics and the polist there's like thousands of them and they're often small like maybe a thousand 10,000 people but the two major polices are Athens and Sparta and Athens and Sparta are both Greek but they're different societies in fact they're nothing alike okay so let's go over why well first of all Sparta is on flat land the Pelpines and if as if you're on flat land you can you can use agriculture but to use agriculture you need slaves okay so Sparta became a war society that conquered the surrounding people and turned them into slaves called helotss so these helotss were um yeah surfs slaves who farmed and so the Sparta became a war society based on military dominance the entire society was centered around how to take young boys turn them into great warriors so that they could they could defend their land okay the Spartans were also very conservative why because your concern is to maintain control over the helotss if you went over to conquer other places the helots could ever could rebel against you okay and so if you want to know what this place is like think China okay so this is very similar to China uh and as a result of this system Sparta was an oligarchy meaning ruled by the few so only Spartans who were born to both a Spartan father and a mother were citizens everyone else was not a citizen so even your father was Spartan but your mother was not Spartan you were not a citizen okay so there's a massive class hierarchy in Sparta and the reason why is for them the priority was to maintain the status quo okay the Athenians are a different people the Athenians don't have good farmland but they have a good harbor okay so and the territory around them it's mountainous so they can't really grow crops but they do but they are able to grow a crop called olives okay so they have a lot of olive trees and so what happens is the Athenians have no choice but to be expansionist okay so they built a really strong navy and they focus on trade and piracy and that's how they sustain themselves over time so whereas the Spartans are conservative the Athenians are both open and expansionist and also what's really important to understand is that if you're a navy you have to be a democracy the rule in um Greece is that you fight for us you can vote you can speak in public you can participate in politics now um Sparta was a land army with hoplets hobblelets are elite soldiers and as a result they were an oligarchy okay because only a few of them fought but Athens was a uh democracy because it had a navy in a navy everyone could roll okay to be h you to buy weaponry you have to train for like decades but the Athenians had a navy where anyone can just roll okay and so they were a democracy all right and so over time because Athens is democracy that's expanding Sparta is um a land power um Athens will start to increase in power sparta will decrease in power and eventually these two will come in conflict with each other okay in something called the Pelpedian war eventually this gives rise to thieves and eventually over time these three states Athens thieves and Sparta will reach a equilibrium okay so similar to the waring states where they inter each other and they use war as a way to resolve their domestic tensions as opposed to try to conquer each other and this gives opportunity for a new power to arise that was previously thought of off as backward poor and isolated and this power is called Macedonia so what Macedonia is going to do is they're going to take all the major military innovations of Sparta thieves and Athens to create the world's most powerful army okay and what else they're going to do is they're going to recruit a lot of talent from these places and then what's going to happen is that Macedonia is going to come and conquer the entire Greek mainland the Macedonians will be the first to unite Greece okay now who who's doing all this his name is Philin okay philip Sen is probably the greatest military genius one of the greatest military geniuses in human history but we don't remember him because he has a son who's actually more famous than he is and his name is who axen the Great why is Axen the Great more famous because Aon the Great will take everything that Phil built and he will use it to conquer Persia okay and um then what will happen is that as this system reaches another equilibrium a new power rise that will overflow this entire system and this power is called Rome okay which we will discuss next class okay so you see how this pattern works right it's a consistent pattern throughout human history all right okay so what happened is that action the will conquer the Persian Empire all right uh where's the Persian Empire egypt Anatolia the Levant Mesopotamia this is Persia um okay so this is like the entire world and like this small army okay it's not even the entire Greek army it's basically it's Macedonians only this small army the Macedonians they're able to come and they're able to conquer all of it okay and the question then is how well the same reason why uh theQing was able to conquer the Jou the way in the Chu right because of elite competition elite overp production within these areas because um these elites have no loyalty so so a lot of these leads were switching sides over time so what probably happened was that these certain elites invited Alexander to come over and then he switched sides so he was very quickly able to bulldoze also remember that when you reach an equilibrium you become lazy stupid and arrogant right so this guy Darius he is now the um king of kings okay he's leading the Persians and he always believed that at some point Alexander would stop okay he'd be like "You know what you have Egypt you have the Levant you have Anatolia you have parts of Mesopotamia you know what I'll do i'll give you all this territory plus I'll give you half my treasury." So Darius thought he could just bribe Alexander and his father Phil would have been like "That's a great deal i'm happy." Sure but Alexander was not like that okay alexander is considered himself the son of God and you will discover that all these great conquerors believe that they are divinity that they are a son of God and they came on earth in order to unify the world okay genghask Con was like this julius Caesar was like was like this napoleon was like this all these great conquerors are unlimited like their appetite for conquest is insatiable so and this was unimaginable for these people like we're giving you like all the money in the world and I said that's not enough okay we'll give the entire world that's not enough man i want it all so he kept on going and he killed D sorry and then Darius died and he conquered the entire um Persian Empire the problem though is that Alexander was being co-opted by the Persian elite remember it was part of the Persian elite that invited Alexander to come over and a lot of the Persian elite were switching sides so Alexander was incorporating more and more of the Persian elite into his army as well as into his administration and so his Macedonian army is not happy about this so they get they get together and they assassinate him okay and now the world is divided among his generals okay and this creates what we call the Henistic age okay the world of the Greeks and what is special about this world is now all three major cultures that came after the collapse of the bronze age the Jews the uh Greeks and the Persians come together in what we call synretatism synatism just means a combining of religions to create the basis for western civilization okay the secretism will also give birth to a new religion that forever changes the world and it is called Christianity okay so Christianity is comes from a merger of these three major worldviews okay now once the Greeks talk of the world they have a problem which is there's not that many of them okay so how do they control the world well they control the world through religion through culture so the what they will do is um a man named Aristotle who is um Macedonian and and like this is something that you do not learn in history class and it is such an important fact okay but the important fact is this philip the second the man who conquered Greece and Aristotle consider one of the most famous philosophers in human history they were childhood best friends okay they grew up together and it's something that you will never ever learn in school okay but it's a very important fact that you you you need to understand so so way of saying this is that um the Macedonians had a plan of the world for a long long time so what would happen is that Phili would go to Greece to learn all the military innovations but Aristotle would go to learn all the intellectual innovations of Greece so his teacher was Plato okay so he learned from Plato and the academy and what will do is he will take Greek knowledge he will systemize it into a knowledge of empire okay so what do I mean by that all right so we discussed Plato we discussed how for Plato what matters is the spirit the mind create the soul the immaterial so this is the good or the god the good and the good emanates and creates the shadow world which is the world that we live in but our goal in life is to return to the good by seeking knowledge by learning truth um by learning something called sacred geometry so for Plato secret geometry are these shapes that underpin reality okay so once you're able to master sacred geometry you're able to master the fabric of the universe and so that's what Plato taught now if you're an empire you don't want this crap okay why because as an empire you want to maximize the energy of each individual you want the person to work as hard as possible to make as much money as possible because that energy then can be sucked up by the empire okay if you're just sitting around reading books that's we don't want that crap okay so now what Aristotle has to do is create a new philosophy that counter counters Plato actually Aristotle probably didn't create this he probably stole it from someone else okay but the philosophy is very simple for Aristotle he doesn't talk about the spirit world he only talks about the material world okay for for Aristotle what makes the world move is cause and effect so I push you you move forward you move forward you bump someone else and that person bumps into someone else okay cause and effect now this this theory implies that there must have been a god called a prime mover okay because someone must have been the first to move things that person must have been God okay but what's important about the in this idea is the prime move doesn't matter because the prime move is the first move we don't have to worry about him anymore okay all we have to worry about is the goal the end okay we don't have to worry about the beginning we have to worry about the end what is the end the end is something called tilos telos okay purpose okay when what this means is that we're all here to achieve our purpose in life okay so you are students what's your purpose to learn so if you learn if you learn you become a good student because you're fulfilling your purpose i'm a teacher my purpose is to teach as well as I can okay so work hard and produce energy for the empire okay so that this is the Aristotle um idea this is important uh because this conflict between Plato and Aristotle is really the underlying conflict in all of Western philosophy okay we'll see this all the time we will see this emerge in um Europe with um and so Plato becomes what we call the rationalist so Decart and becomes what we call the empiricist okay so please remember this conflict empiricis all right plato believes in mind over matter aristotle says mind doesn't matter let's focus on matter okay that's all that matters i don't know mind mine let's just focus on matter okay and the British Empire will adopt this idea in fact all empires will adopt this idea including the American Empire all right okay any questions before um we go to the PowerPoint this is all clear all right so let's go to the PowerPoint the Greek legacy okay all right so as I discussed the geography of Greece is really important so Greece is a very poor place that is mountainous and hilly so it's almost impossible for an empire to develop in Greece because there's not enough wealth there's not enough um resources to support an empire so so during this time there are thousands of polices that are in conflict with each other and this allows for massive innovation what's also important about Greece is that it is by the sea which allows Greece to access different parts of the world okay if you cross the Aian you get into Persia which is the wealthiest part of the world the Mediterranean gives you access to Egypt as well as to northern Africa as well okay so Greece really benefited from this geography that's why uh Greece was so innovative because you can actually steal knowledge from Egypt it steal a lot of knowledge from Egypt okay that's something that is not really knowledge but you can see how close Egypt is okay so uh the Greeks sold a lot of knowledge from Egypt and from Anatolia Mesopotamia and Persia but they also steal knowledge from uh northern Europe as well okay um so remember that the two major city states are Sparta and Athens um thieves is the third major city state macedonia is up here somewhere so where's Macedonia around here somewhere okay and uh the thing about Macedonia is that throughout most of this history it doesn't really matter and throughout this mo most of this history is actually a subject of Persia it's a very mountainous area and so it was poor backwards for the longest time okay okay so this is a map of Sparta now Sparta becomes the military power of the Greeks because um as you can see the Pelpine it's pretty flat which allows for agriculture with agriculture you need slaves so the Spartans had to go conquer the people and turn them into slaves called the helotss and their main concern in life became how do we keep the helotss under control because they're outnumbered 10 to one okay so the helotss were both the major resource of Sparta but they also the major danger to Sparta and Sparta didn't really care about anyone else so the Spartans were concerned first and foremost about how to turn their boys into warriors and so the first thing they did that's most important is they took the children away at age six or seven or five okay because remember we discussed this previously if you want people to be great warriors you have to create anxiety in them okay if they are loving people they don't want to kill other people but if they are divorced from their parents they have conflict with their parents they don't really like life they really got killing okay so these boys were take was were taken away from parents at age uh five or six and then they were put with other boys where they were beat up every day they were beat up every single day when they were 14 15 they um had a mentor who was like maybe 30 years old and they became lovers okay and that's how you build commie um fraternity in the army and then when 1819 they had initiation um ceremony where at night they would hide in the fields and wait for a helot a slave to break curfew okay if if you stay up outside if you stay outside um beyond sun um set then you broke the law and so what these soldiers would do is they would hide wait for a hella to break curfew and then go and slit the guy's throat okay and that was basically the graduation ceremony for the spawn this this is a brutal brutal people but guess what guys the the Romans were the same thing the Aztecs were the same thing the Americans are the same thing okay all right so um what's important to understand is that at this time in history the Greeks are developing massive innovation in military warfare because they're always at war with each other and the major innovation is called the hoplights okay the hoplights is basically to create a wall together so you can bulldo over your enemy also in this time in history the Persians are developing horse archers and this is a major military innovation for them what's really important for us to understand is like the these two innovations happen because of their distinct geography you couldn't have horse archers in Greece because the land is too hilly the land is too poor to support horse archery okay you couldn't have hoplights in Persia because the land is too wide okay so what this means is that yes Persia is the dominant empire in the world but when they go to Greece to attack the Greeks they cannot use their horse archers which is their major military innovation and as a result the Greeks are able to use hoplights and bulldo over the Persians all right so this is the battle of Marathon which is the first great military engagement between the Greeks and the Persians the Greeks again the Athenians especially Athenians they're going and causing a lot of problems for Persians they are they're committing piracy they're also going around and encouraging Greeks under uh the Persian rule to not pay taxes greeks do not like to pay taxes it's still true in today okay uh Greeks hate paying taxes and so this is the first major mil confrontation between the Athenians and the the Persians called the Battle of Marathon and this is 490 BCE and the Athenians won because as I told you the Persians use horse archers they can't use horse archers in Greece they're forced to use um infantry but when it comes to infantry versus infantry the Greeks are are the best at that so avoid head-on collisions with the Greeks okay all right so um this will lead to a series of wars between Persia and Greece and what will happen is that there will be two major in invasions and they will both fail okay the the one that I'm most uh interested in is the purple okay this is the last major invasion of the Persians into Greece what will happen is that they will create this land bridge okay uh on the Bosphorus they basically have ships it's a land bridge and they will cross over and this leads to the famous battle of Ferupi okay you may have seen the movie 300 where 300 Spartans stood stood against like you know a lot of Persians well uh the Persians eventually crush the uh Spartans and what they will do is they will take Leonitis who's the king of Spartans and they will cut off his head and put him on the pike okay and that this is considered a major insult to the Greeks then what they will do is they will go to Athens uh which is here and they will burn down Athens and at this point the war should be over right but what happens is the Athenians are like you know what we're a polless a polus is not a place it's a people so what we'll do is we'll get on our ships and sell off and the Persians are like you can't do that man athenian is like yeah we can man so Athenians are sell off and the war continues okay Athena should have been destroyed but it's not destroyed and at this point the Persian have won the war and all the Persians have to do is stay where they are and land their navy okay they have a massive navy into Sparta because Sparta has a weakness right sparta has helots so all they do is land in Sparta and the helots will rise up against Sparta and the war is over game over okay the problem with empires is they're lazy stupid and arrogant okay so um Xerxes who's leading this invasion he thinks that you know what this strategy of winning the war for attrition is not honorable because I want to go back and build a monument to myself okay so I want to face the Greeks in a major confrontation and this confrontation is called the battle of Salamus okay the battle of Salamus and as I where's Salamus um yeah right here okay and this is considered the greatest naval battle in human history because it forever changed the course of human history now at this point I I keep on saying this the war is over you don't have to do anything just let troops into Sparta uh the Pelpineese and the Hellet will rise up and destroy the Spartans and the war is over you've conquered all of Greece okay do not risk your navy in a military confrontation so of course the the Persians decide we're going to risk our navy and so this leads to the battle of Salamus which ever again forever changed the course of human history all right um so this this is another map showing you what what happens okay and now we are in the battle of Salamus um and we know about the battle cylus because of a name named Herodotus uh uh Heroditus who wrote a book called histories and he's considered a father of history because he wrote the first historical work what he did is he basically went around Greece and he collected memories of the Persian wars um a few decades after the fact and he wrote it all down okay um if you read the histories it's really funny it's really interesting but we have to take it with a grain of salt okay okay so he writes about the battle of uh ferupi okay and again at this point in his history the war is over you don't have to do anything but again Xerxes says I want a monument okay i want to witness a great climic battle between my navy and the Greek navy okay so he sends his navy into battle and of course they get destroyed because again it's really important you don't fight the Greeks face on okay you don't do that because the Greeks are heavily armored and you're not okay so um this is a Greek uh tri okay so Greek tri the thing to to recognize about is it's mainly soldiers so they're really fast they have some uh soldiers on top marines on top okay so they're really good at ramming you and destroying your ship the leader of the Athenian Navy his name is Fezicles and Fzles is one of the greatest generals in Athenian history he's actually the guy who proposed that Athens build a navy um Athens discovered a silver mine and they use all the silver to build their navy to prepare for the Persian invasion okay and it was Fezicles who led the Athenians against the Persians okay and this is what the battle looks like okay so you have you still have this massive Persian army converging against the Athenians but again guys don't fight the Greeks head on okay so they're like you know we're going to fight them head on so you see this massive army converging against the Athenians and now they're they're they're converging against each other okay and the Athenians destroy them okay yeah don't fight the Greeks head on all right and now the entire Persian Navy is scattered the war is over now because now the Persians have lost their navy which means that they cannot resupply they have no more no mobility and so what will happen next is that the uh so yeah the Athenians destroy the Persian navy what happened next is um the Spartans will not want to destroy the remaining Persian forces in Greece okay this is why you don't do I can't I'm sorry it's just the dumbest thing I've ever seen okay they won the war and they screwed it up okay um once you lose a Navy you can't resupply once you re once you can't resupply you've lost the war all right so this is from Heroditus all right um so what's going to happen is the war the battle of Salamas is lost and but you know the Persian still have this huge army in Greece and so the Athenian g sorry the Persian king Xerxes he's he's like I'm out of here man you know I came here to burn down Athens i've done that i'm gonna go home now and I'm gonna let my general Monius take care of the Greeks okay so Mononius is like you know I don't really want to fight these guys anymore so Monius sends an envoy to the Athenians and said "You know what the king of kings York says this we're really sorry we burned down your city really sorry we burned down your temple but we'll give you a lot of money so please stop fighting us." Okay um and this is what the envoy says to the Athenians okay can you read please why are you so mad as to love your war against the king for neither can you get the better off him nor can you resist him forever you are acquainted with the multitude of Xerxes army and their achievements you have heard of the force that is even now with me so that even if you should get the better of us and conquer of which however you can't have no hope if you think soberly another much more numerous will come against you okay so this is idea of empire right just mass organization and death we are infinite in our resources we are infinite in our wealth we can just throw army after army after army against you athenians you're like this small little city okay give up already and the Athenians respond with this okay we ourselves are aware of this that the power of the Medis mess meets me is Persian okay oh mess is far greater than ours so that there was no need to insult us with that but nevertheless being ardent for liberty we will defend ourselves in such manner as we are able but do not you attempt to persuade us to come to terms with the barbarian for we will not be persuaded go then and tell Mardonius that the Athenians say "So long as the sun shall continue in the same course as now we will never make terms with Xerxes but we will go out to oppose him trusting in the gods who fight for us and in the heroes whose temples and images he holding them in no reverence has burned okay so these two passes show you the difference between empire and the borderlands right the empire is about mass organization death the borderlands the Greeks are about openness energy and cohesion okay the Athenian say to the persons we know you're bigger than us we know you're stronger than us but we believe in liberty we believe in each other we believe in our gods and therefore we'll fight you to the end okay all right so what will happen is that now that Xerxes is gone now that the navy is scattered Mardonis is kind of screwed okay and so what will happen is the Spartans face off against Mardonis in the battle of Palia and they they will destroy uh Mardonis mardonis is killed and so one of the soldiers says to the king of the Spartans "Uh Passenius Pacenius your uncle Leonitis was killed by the Persians and they put his head on a spike why don't you return the favor and put the head of Mardonius on a on a sp on on a pike and show it to the world and show how great the Greeks are?" This is Pson's response to this okay can you read posonius answered "I admired your good intentions and your foresight but you have failed to form a right judgment for having highly extolled extolled me my country and my achievement you have thrown all down against me uh to nothing by advising me to insult a dead body and saying that if I do so I shall increase my fame which is more fit for barbarians to do than Greeks and which we uphore even in them i cannot therefore in this matter please the uh ajini ajini nor those who nor those to whom such things should be pleasing it is sufficient for me to please the Spartans by doing and speaking what is right as Leonitis Leonitis whose death you exhort me to avenge I affirm that he has been amply avenged both he and all the others who fell at their mob play have been avenged by the countlessness of these men however do not you hereafter come to me with such a proposal nor give such advice and be thankful that you escaped unpunished okay so what he's saying is that we won because the gods favor us why do the gods favor us because we are virtuous because we are loyal to the gods we're loyal to ourselves we are not the barbarians we are not the Persians we are the Spartans okay so you can see at this time in history how um for the Greeks what matters is their virtue their faith and their loyalty okay but guess what this all changes when they become an empire okay so I I want you guys to remember this and what we're going to do now is we're going to compare and contrast this when what happens when they become an empire okay um Okay all right so the Persians are scattered and they're never they're never going to come back and now it's the Athenian Empire and so what um the Athenians propose is you know what it's always possible that the Persians will want to return so we need to set up a alliance to defend ourselves against the Persians okay and they call it the Dillian League why because they agree that they will pull the resources together as a defense fund against the uh person so think of like NATO okay the North Atlantic Treaty Organization they agree that they will put all their gold in a place called Delos okay an island in Delos somewhere um yeah it's somewhere yeah it's right here it's a small island in Del right here okay you guys see it and so no one no one's allowed to touch this so what happens is that the Athenians are like you know what it's probably safer with us so the Athenians steal all this gold and now the Dian league is no long is no longer a alliance but a empire the Athenian empire where everyone now has to pay tribute to Athens okay so all that's happened is before these Greek city states have to pay tribute to the Persians and now they have to pay tribute to the Athenians okay it's probably a worst deal for everyone and what do the Athenians do with all this gold they spend it on this okay it's called the Parthonon it's still there in Athens if you you want to go visit it it's it's lost its former glory okay but this is what the Parthonon looked like during the age of Pericles during the age of the Athenian Empire okay this is a statue of uh Athena it's pure gold they didn't have to do this but they were like you know what we're going to enjoy our empire they built uh the the Athenian statue okay and so at this time in history the Athens is beautiful it's wealthy and what that does is it makes you lazy arrogant and stupid okay all right so this is fusidities and he wrote um the pelpina war um and he discusses why Athens went to war with Sparta okay and what he says is well it's because Sparta is the hegeimon and Athens is the rising power and therefore they were bound to clash okay that's not what happened athens was the hedgeimon happens with the empire and his allies were rebelling against it and it would it drag Sparta into the war okay that's what that's what what what really happened all right so this is what the war looks like the Athenians have their empire the Spartans have their alliances and what's going to happen is the allies are going to try to break out of the Athenian empire okay and they're going to drag Sparta into the war sparta does not want to fight Athens but Athens forces Sparta to fight it because Athens is very expansionist okay so you can see how this red is now encroaching on the Pelpineese which is historically uh Spartan uh territory right now the problem is that remember Sparta has a weakness the helotss if the Athenas ever choose to land forces on its coast the Helotss would all rise up together and overwhelm the Spartans okay so Sparta must protect its periphery from uh Athenian encroachment so this is what leads to the war okay this doesn't make sense okay Sparta does not want this war the Athenians are extremely aggressive they're expanding everywhere and Sparta is forced into this war the allies use this opportunity in order to try to break out of the Athenian uh empire and so most of Palinian war is actually between Athens and its former colonies and allies okay because Athens is a mafia state now what's important for us to understand is that because of the nature of this war the way they fought the war was strange okay so Sparta is not trying to destroy Athens and Athens is not is not trying to destroy Sparta it's really easy for Athens to destroy Sparta right all Athens has to do is land forces in Sparta and let the Hella to rise up but Athens doesn't want to do that because they will destroy the equilibrium okay you don't know what would happen if the allot helots were to take control of Sparta they might come after you Athens okay so Athens is status quo power therefore it wants to maintain the equilibrium now let me ask you this question how could Sparta defeat Athens very easily right they could just free the hell out right now their army rises 10 times they can now overwhelm Athens but doesn't want to do that because it would destroy their equilibrium okay it would destroy their social order it would destroy their oligarchy it would create a democracy basically and they don't they don't want that okay so they're trying to they're trying to fight the war in a way that allows to maintain equilibrium and that's why the war is fought in a very strange way okay they're not trying to destroy each other they're trying to maintain a balance of power what will happen is that Sparta will eventually defeat Athens but choose not to destroy Athens because if destroy Athens then thieves and other powers could arise which could challenge Sparta okay right all right so the leader of um Athens at this time is Pericles and Pericles is famous for the funeral which is considered like the most famous speech in um western civilization and I I I'm sorry uh but in university they will teach you that the funeral is a speech about democracy it's not a speech about democracy if you actually read it it's a speech about empire okay um for whatever reason the British and Americans believe that Athens was the greatest democracy in the world and they can do no wrong no no no it's an empire and it's concerned only with maintaining its empire okay so we're going to read from the funeralation and the thing remember about funeralation is that Athens is not at war lots of Athenians are getting killed in this war and the custom is for uh there to be a massive state funeral to celebrate the war dead and they give a a a speech to commemorate the war dead okay so we can't read all the speech but I want to show you a very important paragraph in the speech okay all right comfort therefore not condolence non condolence is what I have to offer to the parents of the dead who may be here numberless are the chances to which as they know the life of man is subject but fortunate indeed are they who draw for their lot of lot of death so glorious that which has caused your mourning yet who you yet you who are still of an age to beget children must spare up in the hope of having others in their steedstead not only will they help you to forget those whom you have lost but will be to the state at once a reinforcement and a security okay so he's talking to these uh parents whose sons are now dead okay and remember like during the Persian wars the Athenians are like we're a virtuous people we believe in liberty we believe in our gods we believe in each other and that's why we'll win this war okay now what Pericles is saying to these parents is you know what your sons were useless anyway but now they died for empire which is good right now you can be proud of your sons who are worthless but now that they died for empire we can't celebrate them so what should you guys do you should have more children so that you can protect the empire okay all right that's what he's saying he's also saying to um the Athenians listen I know these men are dead and they have children but don't worry because what we're going to do is we will put these children into an into an orphanage and raise up to be soldiers so that so that they can go and fight for the empire and die like their fathers okay this is now empire guys all right so um this is the plague of Athens so again what Perules should be doing is embarking on a massive war of expansion against the Sparta and Sparta would lose very quickly perles doesn't do that because he doesn't want to fight the Spartans if he defeats the Spartans it creates an imbalance of power in the Greek mainland okay so what he does is he forces everyone to seek shelter within Athens because remember Sparta is a land power he doesn't want to face Sparta on land so he forces everyone to go into Athens and hide behind the city walls guess what happens if you put a lot of people in one place you get the play guys okay this kills a third of the Athenian population including Pericles and his two sons all right so uh can you read can you read this so what's happening is that you have the these different islands who are either rebelling against Athenians or who say to the Athenians we don't want to be part of the stupid war okay and Athenians go to them and says "Too bad guys." Okay keep on going athenians for ourselves we shall not trouble you with spaces specious species pretenses either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the meat or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us and make a long speech which would not be which not be believed and in return we hope that you instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the list as a these are the Spartans okay sedonians although they're colonists or that you have done us no wrong we'll aim at what is feasible holding in view that holding view the real sentiments of us both since you know as well as we do that right as the world goes is only in question between equals in power while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must okay so you know the Persians when they went to the Athenians basically said we are a vast empire you can't defeat us and let's just be friends and and and now now that the Athenians have defeated the Persians now they're the empire basically what they say to everyone else is "We're not even going to bother trying to be your friends we're not even going to bother trying to convince you that we're right and you're wrong we're just stronger than you to shut up and obey." Okay this is the entire point of the Athenians the Athenians are even worse than the Persians okay remember the the Athenians fought the Persians for liberty once they become an empire and others want liberty too bad because Athenians are stronger might makes right okay all right um so this war will drag on and because as an empire you become lazy stupid and arrogant the Athenians will do stupid things like go invade a uh people that don't even that even not part of this war okay Sicily so remember um the Athenians it's a mafia state what they do is they collect tribute from the allies but as this war is stragging on they need more and more money so they decide to go conquer conquer more and more people so they decide let's go conquer Sicily because it's very wealthy they send a massive expedition against Sicily they get they lose and they drag Syracuse which has a navy into the war now Sparta Syracuse combined against the Athenians and the Persians come in as well okay the allies go turn against spar f Athens and what they will do is they will blockade athens from uh fric which is where Athens gets most of its wheat okay so now Athens is going to starve so Athens surrenders and this ends the pelpian war and this time as remember that Spartans could choose to destroy Athens they don't choose to because they're not interested in winning the war they're only interested in maintain the status quo equilibrium okay and of course this gives rise to Macedonia okay now remember this is really important for the second what he will do is he will go into the Greek mainland and learn all the major innovations of the theans the Athenians and the Spartans he will create something called the master fallank which becomes the most dominant military force in history at this point he has a child best friend Aristotle who will go to Athens and learn from Plato and he will systemize all Greek knowledge so that so that he can take this knowledge and turn it into a um tool of empire okay okay so um Phil the second will focus on military conquest of the world but will focus on cultural imperialism okay all right so what makes Philip such a genius is to understand listen Persians have their horse archers the Athenians and the Spartans have their hopes okay so but what I can do is I I can take all these major innovations together and combine them into one military package and that allows me for coordination okay so I can have flexibility and mobility in my army the problem though is like for that to happen you need to make sure that every soldier is highly motivated that every soldier wants to fight now traditionally um if you have an army different section of your army get special privileges okay usually the cavalry because these are aristocrats they get all the privileges and everyone else their life sucks but what Philip the second understood is like no no no I need to make sure that everyone is happy so he focused on increasing the morale of his soldiers and it's very easy guys okay all you do is be metocratic if a soldier is doing a good job you promote him if a soldier is doing a bad job you demote him and you think that's easy but it's not because what it what it means is you have to overturn the social hierarchy okay because the aristocrats are just used to like doing whatever they want but Phil was insistent no no no every soldier will be treated fairly this is going to be a meritocracy and this is what allowed him to create the world's greatest army okay now once you have these different forces in place you can now have major military innovation and what is major military innovation was something called the anvil and hammer okay basically what would happen is like your infantry will lock with the other infantry in place okay this called the anvil and then what will happen is your cavalry will sweep in from behind to smash the enemy cavalry this called the hammer and this is what allowed Alexandra to conquer all of Persia because no other army had witnessed such a powerful force and you can't really possibly respond to it okay once the army once the infantry locks you in place you can't escape then the cavalry comes in and smashes you in apart okay the anvil and the hammer so what will happen is that um Phil the second will go conquer Greece because remember at this time Greece are dividing into city states they're all fighting each other and they're not interested in actually conquering each other they're just interested in maintaining equilibrium so Philip the second is like you know what screw the system i'm going to come break all the rules and I'm going to conquer everyone so this is the battle of Sherania which is where he defeats a combined force of Athenians and Athenians and now he controls all of uh mainland Greece and now he's ready to do what is what he really wants which is to conquer Persia why because Persia is where the money is right greece is poor persia is wealthy therefore I'm I'm gonna take this army and go conquer Persia um so this is the year 336 when Philip II has conquered all mainland Greece and he's now ready to invade Persia in fact he has also spies throughout Persia he also has diplomats throughout Persia negotiating with the local elites okay so he's now ready to go and conquer uh Persia uh unfortunately he gets killed okay so he goes to the wedding of his daughter and his bodyguard kills him and there's historical debate as to who killed this but the answer is pretty simple okay his wife uh his wife Olympias why would Olympia who is the mother Alexander the Great kill her husband it's really really simple um if you're a king you marry a lot of foreign women for alliances olympias is not Macedonian and um so there's a lot of people in the Macedonian court who who dislike her abel the great is here to the throne but as a young man he was notorious for being a thug okay he's not like Phil is very deliberate he's very strategic a the great is basically a thug so Philin was worried about about the great so later in his life he married a Macedonian woman and they had a son together okay what this means now is that this son is now here to the throat and not the great Olympias taught Alexander the Great from day one that you are special Alexander you are not the son of Philip the second you're the son of God son of God okay and so Olympias when she felt that Philip second was about to steal the throne from Alexander she had him killed and we know because after the Philip second was killed who else did she kill the wife the the new Macedonian wife as well as the son right okay so this is a nasty person Philip the Asen the great will take Philip's great army and he will go conquer Persia with it okay and this is what his conquest path looks like he will do this in like 10 years time he'll conquer like the entire world basically in 10 years time what's important is the way that he moves okay he moves really quickly with small army which tells us that he needed cooperation from local elites okay remember at this time in history uh Persia has reached an equilibrium it's stagnant there's no innovation going on there's a lot of competition between the upper nobility and low lower nobility okay so the low ability plot was probably helping Alexander um um conquer Persia two things I wanted to keep keep you to understand about this map first of all is like the moment that um Axer reaches Persia he goes to Troy why does he go to Troy because Achilles went to Troy so Axander saw himself as the new Achilles okay in fact um he had memorized the Iliad and he took the Iliad with him wherever he went okay so that's the first thing I I want you to um appreciate also what he did during the war was he took one of his enemies tied his enemy to the back of his chariot and rolled the guy around okay just like Achilles did to Hector the other thing that's really important even more important is like you see what happened when he visits Egypt okay he conquers Egypt and then he decides to go all the way over here to Ammon okay why does he do that because there's a oracle at Ammon and he spent a few days with his oracle and his oracle told him his secret the secret is this you are not the son of Philen you're the son of God which who is Zeus Aman okay so Zeus is the king of king of the gods in the Greek tradition aman is king of the gods in the Egyptian tradition so in other words Alexander was born to rule the world who was destined to conquer the world and this explains why when he conquered most of Persia and Darius said to him "You know what here's a billion dollars go away." As like "No screw you i want all of this." Okay not only that but even after he conquered Piperilus which the capital of Persian Empire he kept on going to India okay the only reason why he stopped is his soldiers got sick of fighting um the other thing about Alexander that's really important is he was known for his atrocities so he burned down the city of thieves and he burned down the city of Piperilus why would he do that well um if you understood that he saw himself a son of god then it's possible we we'll never know okay it's possible that burning down thieves and burning down pipulus were ritual sacrifices necessary to prove that he was a son of God okay so yeah he did a lot of like bad things but there's really nothing um random about what he did he thinks he the things he did were for diplomatic military purposes okay all right so um this is a map of his conquest okay um this is a burning of Pipulus you can actually still visit Pipilus uh today in Iran okay um what he was doing while his conquest was that he was slowly killing off his father's most loyal man so Parmmen who was um Phil's top general Alexander killed and then Cletus who was also not top general he killed as well okay now his historically we remember these events as um random acts of violence but they're not okay alexander slowly need to kill off his father's men so that he could create his own empire okay um and so what happened was that eventually the other generals were like you know eventually Axen is going to come going to kill us as well so they conspired and poison him and now what they will do is they will fight amongst themselves and create the Greek world okay it's divided into um four major parts and the four major parts are Tommy takes Egypt which is the wealthiest part of the empire um then you have Macedon then you have Anatolia and then you have the Seucian Empire okay all right so the problem though is like once you conquer most of the world um you have to rule over the world and there are that many Greeks so what they will do is they will build Greek cities to settle their veterans invite more Greeks to come help them govern um um the empire but they also need need to recruit bureaucrats okay so um they recruit these Persian bureaucrats because they're very effective but they also recruit Jews as well into the empire okay because Jews are a foreign people okay because remember the because these people the Greeks need to omit to control and manage their empire okay all right so what I want you to focus now is on Egypt okay because historically Egypt was the center of the world it was the cultural capital of the world and Egypt helped to help give science and math to uh Greece okay now the Greeks are like controlling Egypt and the Egypt is like wait a minute here you guys were barbarians now you're controlling us why is this happening so now the Greeks need to explain what's happening and so what they do is they create cultural imperialism all right okay uh this is um the Greek world so they're building Greek cities all around um the world and these cities are very similar there's an epitheater sorry uh this is a better map okay this is per pamont okay so you can see what it looks like you have an epithe stage Greek theater you have a gyasium you have um an agora like they're like if you go to these cities they're all very similar to each other okay and this is Greek art which takes over the world as well all right let's just tell them in a second and he and his father taught him the first they will create something called the library of Alexandria okay the library of Alexandria what what what it will do is it will take all the Greek knowledge in the world and it it will systemize it and synize it as textbooks to be taught throughout the world okay so this is really a university um to show you how wealthy the Egyptians are the uh when they built the library of of Alexandria they um needed original manuscripts and so they said to a Athenians "Hey can we borrow some original plays?" And the Greeks are like "No you can't uh because we really love our upidities and our iss you can't just take this stuff this this stuff is priceless." And the Egyptians said "You know what we'll do we'll give you like a billion dollars as a deposit and the Athenians well that's a lot of money oh sure okay all right so the Athenians lend these scrolls to the Egyptians um in Alexandria to copy and then after some time the Athenians said said to Tommy "Hey man give give us back the scrolls." And the Tommy is like "Keep the money." That's how wful they were they had all the money in the world they didn't care keep the money $10 million keep the money man and the Athenians were pissed okay they were really really pissed about this don't ever trust uh yeah anyway this is Library of Alexander it's part of something called the Musead okay so what's really important for us to understand is that a university is not really about education it's not really about literacy culture it's really about a tool of empire to um create a cultural understanding of the world that allows the empire to rule over people okay so the library of of sorry the library of Exanua is an example of this because remember the Greeks are ruling over the Egyptians the Egyptians are like why are you ruling over us and the um Greeks are like because we're culturally superior to you and how do you prove it by uh censoring Egyptian culture okay by by um downplaying Egyptian culture and by uh upplaying by promoting Greek culture okay this is cultural imperialism now this is really important as part of the cultural imperialist project um the Egyptians under Tommy they also started to work with the Jews okay why because Egypt Egypt needed to control the Levant as as well okay who's in the Leavant the Jews the Jews are problematic because they were loyal to the Persian Empire okay so how do you make them loyal to you well you bribe them how do you bribe them by getting their priests by saying the priest you know what we love your tradition we love your culture let us translate your Bible into Greek so that we can celebrate your Bible and spread it around the world and this is what we call the Septuagent the Septuagent okay it's really important uh in our history um and so the Jews were like "Yeah that's a great great thing." But not only that but because um of the library of Alexandria a lot of Jews were going to Alexandria to help contribute to the scholarship there okay so eventually a third of the people in of Alexandria will become Jews okay but Jews are spreading throughout the Greek world and so now what you're seeing is a massive secretism between all three major religions okay the Greeks the Jews and the Persians because the Persians are are administrators in this empire uh the Greeks are ruling this empire and the Jews are helping build this empire okay so this will merge all three major worldviews and this will give us Christianity okay all right so that is the Greek world all right um any questions was was this clear okay so what will happen is like next class we'll discuss Rome okay because Rome will now conquer this um empire and then this will allow for the rise of Christianity and we will do this next week okay so everything was clear today right come
