today we do Rome and um so before we've done Persia um the Jews and the Greeks and these are the three um main civilizations after Brontage collapse and now we will emerge Rome to eclipse all three and build a world empire okay and what I will argue to you today is that Rome is the great anti-ivilization um or you can call it just the evil empire okay all right so what do we know about Rome well like most great empires they emerge initially at the borderlands of another cultural empire okay know these are the atruskians and the atruskians are very similar to the marinian Greeks and as you can see um they are expanding throughout the uh Italian peninsula now the thing about empires is that eventually the people become lazy arrogant and stupid and so what they do is they get people to fight for them so the Romans are here and as you can see um this is the borderlands and the entire area is surrounded by great warriors this is a poor region and so they're always fighting for resources so the Romans get recruited as mercenaries and over time what will happen is that they will start to emerge as the great power in the Italian peninsula and at this point in history this is really important they're surrounded by lots of different people that are like them and they're warlike so they triumph because they become the most warlike of everyone okay their entire society is based on war this is a truskin civilization and um as you can see it is very advanced the Atrusian civilization is heavily in contact with the Egyptians um and the Greeks and as well as people around them because they are ser fairing people and this is the civilization that will most heavily influence uh the Romans as you can see the atricians are always at war as well and then as become wealthier they will recruit the uh Romans to fight for them this is not a great map but this what this map shows you is the gradual expansion of Rome so at first as you can see it is actually at the most disadvantaged location because it's always it's surrounded by enemies um it is on flat land and so it's not easily defensible and it's not really by the coast and therefore it's hard for it to trade but because it is in such a disbanded position it is forced to be the most marshall the most violent the most militaristic the most aggressive and the culture evolves around that and slowly over time they're able to conquer the entire um Italian peninsula and then expand uh to the Mediterranean okay so this is another map that shows you uh Rome and how it's going to expand over time the way it expands is through military conquest and then by building roads and this is very impressive because if you ever been to Italy it is very hilly so there's a tremendous effort to build roads but once they build the roads they're able to consolidate and navigate their empire um this is this is a map that shows you the geography of um Italy as you can see it's very mountainous um and there are that many rivers which tells us it's very poor and because it's very poor the people tend to be very unified uh very aggressive and they have a deep egotarianism because only by working together can you ultimately triumph over the other people okay so there's a main characteristic about Rome in the early days that you must remember it is poor it is small okay and it is uh unified so everyone knows each other and so because of its geographic characteristics we emerge it concept of liberty all right and it's concept of liberty is obedience to the fathers to history to culture because only by doing so can you uh survive as a people now what's interesting about this is it's a different concept from the Greeks the Greeks believe that what liberty is is the right to speak your mind in front of others um and as such the major difference between the Greeks and the Romans is in in Greece citizenship is passed on from family to family but in Rome citizenship can be earned okay it's an open citizenship system why because if you just obey the fathers the laws the customs then you can be a Roman citizen and as such what's going to happen is that as Rome expands it's going to incorporate different people into its culture and as a result Rome has advantage that Athens and Sparta doesn't have rome can always replenish its soldiers and as such it can afford to lose war after war after war but as it does so it gets stronger and stronger because it's learning with each defeat okay and that is the secret to Rome's ultimate victory the heart and center of Roman society is the Senate this is where the um leading families come together to dis to discuss the fate of Rome and at this time in history when Rome is poor this is not a problem because everyone knows each other and there's no real inequality therefore there can be no corruption and so these fathers the senators are representing the representing the best interests of all Romans but over time as Rome becomes wealthier and wealthier this becomes a huge problem because as Rome develops more wealth guess who gets all the wealth these guys okay so we we'll we'll we'll see this later as as that as Rome gets wealthier Rome also becomes much more corrupt all right so the Greeks the fighting system is the hoplets the Romans use something called the legions now there are some major differences between these two fighting techniques even though for their time they are the most advanced as you can see uh the Greek hoplights are heavily armored okay and as such each hoplet needs to buy his own armor which means that hoplights tend to be um small land owners okay they have a bit of wealth the legioners can be poor because it doesn't actually require that much armor to be a legionnaire okay that's the first thing second thing is that it actually takes a lot of training to be a hoplight you basically have to spend years and years honing your skills because you fight information uh the legionnaire you don't you you don't need that much training okay you can actually go straight into battle the third major difference is that as you can see the hoplights they are using heavy armor shields um and helmets the legionnaires are much lighter the reason why is the legionnaires were developed in a developed to fight in a mountainous region so they need to be able to climb to hike up mountains in in formation whereas the Greeks are fighting more on flat land okay so over time what will happen is the legionnaers will overwhelm the hoplets um this is a typical Roman peasant he's spending most of his time farming and when it's required of him he goes to war okay he's not a full-time soldier um so um the Greeks and the Romans will fight a series of wars so as the Romans are expanding they go they go closer and closer to the coast and here are a lot of Greek colonies and the Greeks are losing to the Romans so they call for help from the compatriots um across the sea and a king named Pyrus of Eperis he decides to take advantage of this opportunity to go conquer Italy okay so he and Hoplights sail over to Greece and they are destroying the Romans battle after battle uh Pyrus is defeating the Romans and then he finally says "You know what if I win one more battle I'm going to have no more soldiers." Okay and that shows you the difference between Greek fighting versus Roman fighting greek fighting uses specialized forces that uh can win over time whereas the Romans can just keep on replenishing their forces okay so the Romans don't actually win that many battles but they win most of their wars okay now as the Romans are expanding they eventually reach the Mediterranean and so now they start developing a navy in order to trade with um other uh nations like Egypt and Greece this comes in conflict with the Carthaginians and at this time the main power in the Mediterranean are the Carthaginians now and they will fight a war that lasts decades 100 years and ultimately Rome will triumph and the main reason why that Rome triumphs and this really important for you guys to understand is the main difference between Carthage and Rome is Carthage is rich Rome is poor okay why why what does this matter because if you're rich what you can do is hire mercenaries to fight the war for you and that's what Carthage does but Rome is poor therefore they must use their own citizens to fight the war okay and so over time the citizens become much tougher much more unified whereas the Carthaginians they become more corrupt they be become much more decadent and because the Romans are more invested in the war they will fight to the end whereas the Carthaginians are business people they're traders okay they're very known for um their sharp business skills and so they do they do a costbenefit analysis be like you know what this war is going to cost us more than if we just surrender okay so the carters surrender the first Punic war they s the second Punic war and the third Punic war guess what happens they're going to be wed up by the Romans okay so that's what the Roman mentality is we fight you we'll fight you to the death and if we beat you we will kill every one of you okay that's just the Roman uh war mentality and that's why they ultimately triumph in the end okay so this is another map that shows you the conflict between the Carthaginians and the Romans this is a second Punic War okay so um Carthage over here it's expanded to Spain and there are lots of silver mines in Spain um Rome right now it's still pretty small okay but again because the Romans are dedicated towards war that's that's the only thing they know that's the only thing they're good at okay they will eventually triumph over the Carthageians we actually don't know that much about the history of Rome okay but the most famous episode during the Second Punic War is when a Carthaginian general named Hannibal Barka okay he's in Spain and he decides he's going to go destroy Rome the way he does it is by crossing the Alps okay so these are out mountains and for the longest time Bman thought that this was a natural barrier and what what what Hammer Barker will do is he will cross the Alps with his war elephants and his army land in um Italy and start attacking Rome and in three decisive battles Hannibal will destroy the entire Roman army okay he will wipe out the entire Roman army and at this point in history Rome needs to surrender okay so Hannibal sends an envoy to the Senate and tells them "I destroyed every single one of your soldiers you have no more army therefore I am willing to talk peace terms." And the Senate is like "Screw you come get us." Okay and this marks a turning point in Roman history so let's look over some of the major events this is Hannibal crossing the Alps okay one of the most famous military feats in human history um this is the battle of Trivia one of the first major battles where even though Hannibal is um under man and he's in enemy territory what he will do is he will use a series of brilliant military maneuvers to ambush uh his enemies okay so these are the Romans as you can see what's going to happen is the the um Carthaginians their horsemen lies in the marsh and then they will sneak up and destroy the Romans from the rear okay that's the first major battle this is the battle of Lake Tresamine and the same thing basically happens where the Romans are crossing then the then Hannibal ambushes them from the uh hills okay the second major battle and this is the most famous battle this is about called the battle of Kaine okay and this what we call a double involvement strategy where what will happen is that the two armies meet and then uh Hannibal will send his cavalry on the wings and then they will envelop the Roman army and then they will slaughter everyone okay so Romans lose between 50,000 to 100,000 men their entire army is wiped out because of this battle okay so uh this is the first phase second phase is when the uh cavalry starts to uh flank the uh Romans and in the third phase um the soldiers come in from behind and trap the Romans and kill everyone okay so this is the most famous battle in military history now there's a problem with this battle which is this has never happened before in human history remember before we discussed the idea that in China one of the most um common military strategies is behind the river strategy okay so you force your men to go to a river and now the enemy is approaching them and have no choice but to fight to the end because otherwise they'll drown okay but if you can see this situation it's very similar the Romans are in a very similar situation where they where they're being surrounded by enemies on all sides right so at this time what what should happen theoretically is they become energized and the entire Roman army goes and fights the Carthaginians and defeats the Carthaginians okay we have we have examples of that we don't we don't have an example of in fact an entire army in ancient times being surrounded and being slaughtered by the enemy this is a very strange battle in fact if you ask chat GBT which battles have used double envelopment strategy basically you have battle canine okay we have that but the next one is 1940 1940 in World War II now the difference of course is is that by the time you hit the 1940s you have machine guns you have tanks so if you start an enemy you can destroy your enemy but not in ancient times okay in in fact the closest parallel that we have is a battle of Marathon but even his but some historians suggest okay so we're not very so even historians disagree whether or not the battle marathon was actually double in strategy this makes no sense this battle strategy makes no sense from a military p perspective also we can't find the damn place you would think this is a huge battle 50,000 100,000 women are dead there'd be a lot of bodies we can't find a damn place okay look there's no archeological evidence to prove the battle took place we we don't have any evidence that's kind of strange okay um yeah but maybe it's because of the weather or you know we don't know okay all right guys so um what's going on here okay so on YouTube someone asked me "How do we know what history is true or not?" Okay now you would think the answer is you just ask historians whether it's true or not you know the answer the problem is that every historian that you talk to tells you the battle canal must be historical fact it must be even though we don't have any evidence for it so given that how can we um understand or figure out if it's true or not well in this class what I teach you is a new historical framework to understand history okay so this is predictive of history and we look we ask ourselves does the battle of cannot fit into a larger historical pattern okay second question we ask is does it make sense according to game theory and the third question is does religion explain the battle okay and when we do this we use this framework to understand the back canal our conclusion must be it didn't happen it was completely made up okay the back canal did not happen so why well first of all when we have these great military generals like Kavar Barka they tend to become a king okay so think of Napoleon U or think of Julius Caesar hannah Barker is the first general that we have that conquered all of Rome and decided I'm sit back and like retire for the next 50 years okay never happened before why didn't he go back to Carthage and rec and claim the kingship right okay that's the first problem second problem is game theory okay so if you read Roman history what they would tell you is that Hannibal after the battle of Canal he was stuck in Italy without resources then the question is when he go to Carthage conquer the place and demand the resource he needs to win against Rome why is he sitting back okay also remember this is a guy who crossed the Alps on his own initiative the cockian told him "Don't start a war with Rome Hannibal." And Hannibal's like "Nah I'm going to go across our Alps thank you very much." Okay so this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and then from a religious perspective how can we explain what h why Hannibal did what he did and Roman historians will tell you "Oh it's because his father lost against Rome he wanted revenge for on behalf of his father." That makes no sense guys okay usually when a Napoleon emerges it's because he thinks he's a son of God think think of Napoleon think of Alexander the Great think of Julius Caesar okay they all have a mess calling a divine mission all right so from this only conclusion can be first of all battle did not happen there's no way it could have happened and second thing is you can also say that Hannibal Bark Hannibal Barka did not exist as per as a person all right but then this leads us to a really huge problem which is why would the Romans just make this stuff up why why would they say we fought this battle and 100,000 of our men got killed by this Carthage General Hannibal who was smarter than us okay well the reason why is this Carthage okay that Carthage is at this time in history about 200 BC the most beautiful the most prosperous the most culturous city in the world and what did Romans do they burned it to the ground and killed everyone okay that's the Roman way now um this is a siege of Carthage that lasted many many years in the third punic war the Romans if they don't like you they will come and kill every one of you okay and that's what they did in Carthage now during this war a Greek named Palibius okay Palibius uh was a hostage of Rome and he became the official historian of the Roman Empire so this is a guy who invented the battle of Canaan why to justify the burning of Carthage right because the Romans are like "Why did we kill the Carthaginians?" Because that's what we do man okay but Palibius is Greek and he understands that you know if Rome you're going to be an empire you need people on your side you can't go around just killing people you need you need to explain your actions so in other words Palibius in order to justify the Roman Empire create this entire history of the psychopunic war that didn't really happen okay because now it's like okay well the Romans felt threatened by Hannibal right Hannibal was going to destroy them and so they all saw Carthage as a threat and therefore they had to destroy Carthage now it's much more reasonable okay so Palibus basically made the entire history of Rome the thing to remember about history is that if you're a military power you don't write history why because you you're not capable of reflection you're not capable of deep cultural production okay so the Romans won all these battles and got the Greeks to write their history for them to just justify why they did what they did okay does that make sense guys all right so again I hate to say this but basically um all Roman history is complete nonsense all right um if you read Roman history just don't believe anything you you read okay all right so um let's look at the Roman war machine because after the war against Carthage after Rome destroys Carthage Rome is the undisputed leader of the Mediterranean it's an empire now but it still keeps on fighting these wars overseas for no particular reason why because it has no choice in the matter this is the entire Roman war machine okay so um because Rome is a poor poor place the only way that it can generate wealth is by conquering other people okay so the nobility wants to go fight these wars overseas so that they can capture slaves why because they can get these slaves then to work their estates okay so at this time in history slaves are the main resource that people are fighting over okay now to fight these wars peasants are conscripted into the military but once they leave the land they need to feed the families right so what do they do they borrow money with their land as collateral okay but over time what happens is they can't pay back the interest right they default on the loan and then land owners nobility seize the land then what they do is they get the slaves that they conquer to come work this land right now the peasants have no choice but to go to Rome to look for work because they've lost their land and the Roman state gives them food it's called a grain do okay and so now the nobility wants to go fight more wars what they do is they bribe the peasants to vote for more wars and then the peasant can go and maybe win some booty okay because they have no land and um so what what's happening is that what the R woman war machine is doing is creating slavery debt corruption and inequality okay and over time what happens is that wealth becomes more consolidated in fewer hands which creates conflict between the upper nobility and the lower nobility the optimates are are called the upper nobility and the popular are called the low nobility okay so what's the difference optimates just means the best of the best okay why do I have so much money because I'm better than you are in fact my entire family is better than you are popular is where where we get the word populist from so this is lower nobility people like Julius Caesar who take advantage of the discontent in order to launch their political careers and what they do is they promise the peasants the people u more opportunities okay to take the wealth of the rich and give it more to the poor okay so this is a conflict that will arise in Rome after the end of Carthage and this will last for centuries until the very end of the Roman Empire okay the in other words the Roman war machine doesn't know how to stop even even when it becomes an empire all this aggressive military energy then translate translate into civil war okay so the Romans aren't killing other people they're killing each other all right um this is a question from a YouTube um a viewer and uh Ford asks why are wars good at maintaining equilibrium okay why is it that uh wars help reduce a problem of elite over production okay and the reason why is and and I I I know I know it's hard for you guys to understand this but wars are beneficial all right so let's go over the the the benefits of war well first of all you create social co cohesion right you're fighting against another person you have to stand together so it creates a dialectic a hatred of the other which gives meaning and purpose to life okay uh it creates social mobility if you're poor you go fight a war you get lucky you can become pretty wealthy uh wolf destruction and generation okay so you're destroying wealth which allows for more opportunities uh survive the fittest so population control so basically the stronger survive in war the weak die off uh high fertility rate because so many people are dying mothers are forced to have more and more children okay they don't have a choice in the matter um innovate release of social tension so people don't like each other they go fight a war together and now they're best friends um innovation creativity entertainment for nobility okay competition um war is often just the the nobility just enjoys wars because it's like playing a chess game okay they're not the ones dying worst case scenario they become hostages right all right so again what happens is that after Carthage is destroyed the Romans turn against each other okay the first one that happens is something called the social wars basically it's the um Roman allies who were told to fight a war and return they regret citizenship they were not grant grant citizenship so they rebelled against the Roman state and this led to civil war okay but the problem is you're now fighting the Roman army so you're not going to win so eventually the Roman state had to give in and give citizenship to these uh people okay this is uh one of the most radical turning points in Roman history so um right now there's massive inequality in Rome the nobility have all the land they have slaves to work the land the peasants are uh having problems feeding themselves in the cities okay so now what do you do so u this man is named Tyberus Graas and he's a reformer and he says basically here hey guys here's what we're going to do the rich have all this land we're not going to touch that because we have to respect private property but there's all this public land that's not being used it belongs to women state we have all these poor people that want to work the land but they have no land so what we'll do is this we'll take public land that no one's touching okay no one's using this stuff give it to the people to work to generate more wealth for our society we have more tax revenue the people are happier and yeah and no one gets hurt okay perfect perfect solution right because he proposed a solution the nobility beat him to death okay not only did they beat him to death they beat his brother to death as well okay oh my god why do they do this because nobility is how dare you steal our public land from us okay so nobility was like this public land belongs to us man because we are the state screw the people okay all right so of course this leads to the rise of dictators so there have been different dictators who've um come to power and they've tried to solve the social conflict within Rome the first is Marius who promised reform but really didn't deliver then you have Solo okay and Solo's solution was really simple let's just kill all the reformers pretty simple guys okay our problem isn't the inequality the problem is you got too many people uh who proposed reform so he just killed all the reformers okay what and then after he killed the reformers retired one of these reformers who got away was Julius Caesar okay so Julius Caesar because his family was very wealthy was able to escape Solah and but he's a very ambitious man so now he's going to build his political career based on the discontent of the people and what he's going to do is that he's going to um bribe his way into office so that he can get a general ship to go invade Gaul okay so he goes to Gaul which is in modern day France he spends many years there um what's he doing there okay okay well if you look at official Roman history what he's doing there is he's trying to pacify the people of Gaul okay so he has these like these series of mil military campaigns in Gaul and it culminates in uh so he's leading his soldiers into war in Gaul and it culminates in something called the battle of Alicia which one of the most famous battles in history basically what hap what's happening is that um this is the very last battle of um Caesar's G campaign what he's done is he's surrounded a village where his enemies are okay but his enemies send word to all the gic tribes to come and converge against the Romans so what the Romans do is they build fortifications to block out the invaders okay so they're fighting wars on both fronts they're fighting in the inside against the enemies trapped here they're also fighting against the enemies coming from outside as well and u Alicia is one of the greatest battles in human history and again we have reason to think that this didn't happen okay so what was Caesar doing in Gaul and why was he starting all these wars the answer is really simple okay there are three reasons the first is remember slaves are the most valuable commodity at this time so what he's doing is he's basically capturing slaves he's going and he's starting these wars in order to capture slaves caesar said famously um I killed a third of people go i enslaved a third of them and I left a third alone okay so he basically committed genocide against the the people of Gaul and um what's important to understand is he probably exaggerated he probably didn't kill a third why because if he captures slaves a lot of this money has to go to the Roman state but if he kill if he pretends to kill the GS but actually enslaves them then all the money goes to him okay so by enslaving people he became filthy rich in fact he became the wealthiest man in Rome and he used this money to bribe his his um friends into office okay so he became also the most politically powerful individual in Rome that's the reason number one he went why he went to go second is that Caesar um was trying to build a loyal army a private army that was loyal to him and so just because he was able to give money to these soldiers these soldiers not only were loyal to him but they also develop a lot of fun experience while in Gaul right so now Caesar has the world's most powerful army the third reason why he went to go and this most important is to create a myth of himself as a great conqueror um all these great politicians understand people don't really understand the difference between reality and fantasy in fact they don't care what about the difference okay people will believe what they want to believe so what what Cu was doing was he was going to go and then um he was getting people to go back to Rome and announce all his victories okay we have reason to believe that a lot of these victories were made up but it gave the impression among the Romans that Caesar was this great conqueror okay so think of this guy right what's he doing he's trying to create an image of himself as energetic dynamic verile right right does that make sense oh and a better example of course is this guy okay right donald Trump he spent a lot of years in the World Wrestling um Federation trying to portray himself as macho as energetic as strong right and then for over 10 years he had the most popular television show on TV called The Apprentice where he pretended to be this savvy genius of a business person right the Apprentice and this is what really launched his political career all right so this is all these great politicians understand if you really want to have a great political career you have to create a myth of yourself as an entrepreneurial military genius okay so um after Gaul the Roman Senate basically gets really annoyed at Caesar because they understand what he's trying to do he's trying to become king of Rome so they basically try to impeach him okay they they want to put him on trial so Caesar basically rebelss against them and this starts a civil war and what's going to happen is that Caesar is going to go conquer the entire Roman Empire now um it's one man and his army against the entire empire so he should have lost the problem is that the Ottomates are really stupid arrogant and lazy okay there's so um Pompei General Pompei is fighting for the Ottomans and he's going against Caesar and Pompe strategy it's really simple okay Caesar has control over Italy there's a problem though italy is poor it does not have produce enough food so all we have to do is lay siege to Italy and if we start war is over that's all we have to do right we don't have to fight Caesar just lay siege to Italy um the people starve the people rebel against Caesar and then Caesar loses the war the problem though is the optimist afraid that if Pompei won the war then they would make Pompei king right so what the optimist wanted to do was force Pompei and Juju Caesar into a battle and have and kill both okay they wanted to destroy both and this led to something called a battle of Farcus remember at this time Caesar needs to go fight Pompei but Pompei doesn't have actually to fight Caesar but the ultimates force him to fight in a battle called farceless okay and in this battle because Caesar has a loyal army they defeat Pompei even though Pompe has more soldiers okay and then what um Caesar will do is then go conquer the entire Roman Empire and he makes himself dictator of Rome and this of course leads to his assassination why is he assassinated because the Romans are afraid that he'll make himself king and he will abolish a debt of the people and he will reappropriate the land and give it to the people okay he'll basically make himself king by making Rome a much more equal and egalitarian place and so they killed him and this led to more civil war um in which Octavius Caesar Augustus Caesar will will be triumphant because he will inherit Julius Caesar's army and at the battle of Actium in 31 BC he would destroy Mark Anthony and Cleopatra making himself the supreme ruler of the Roman Empire okay and he's really considered the first Roman emperor but what's really important for us to understand is at this point in history um the problems of Rome don't really go away he is emperor and during his time things are stable but after he dies the Roman Empire goes back into civil war and he keeps and it does not stop fighting civil war until its very collapse okay what makes him um emperor is the fact that he will take Egypt and turn into his private property and he will use the wealth of Egypt to fund the army so all the soldiers are now loyal to him individually as opposed to the Roman state okay now August Augustus Caesar he was not a military genius but he he appreciated that if the Roman people were to survive they needed a culture as distinct and as powerful as Greek culture at this time in history the Greeks um were culturally dominant and he's he was afraid that over time all Romans would just become Greeks so he needed to create a culture that was distinct from the Greeks but also considered much more powerful than the Greeks okay so that was his main major contribution to the Roman Empire so what he does is he takes the work of Po Palibius remember Pibius is the main uh architect of the history of Roman Empire and he tells Libby to basically rewrite the history but from a Roman lens as opposed to a Greek lens okay so this is a very really famous book written by Libby uh sponsored by Octavius Caesar okay so we're we're going to read a bit of it to understand the Roman mentality okay all right all right so um what's happening is this the book starts with the founding of Rome and in the Roman tradition what's going to happen is um the Romans are descendants of Troy remember Troy and Aliad was destroyed by the Greeks how did the Greeks destroy Troy through trickery through deception right the Trojan horse and then what will happen is the Greeks flood into the city and kill everyone but there's a Trojan general named Inas and his wife Kisha what he will what they will do is they will escape okay um Troy sorry in order to found Rome now Kishia is the wife and what she what she will do is as they leaving Troy she will kill herself in order to allow Inas to escape fully okay so in the Roman tradition all that matters is the father okay so you can see the father can't walk so Inas has to um shoulder him to the ship and woman don't matter at all okay that's the Roman tradition all right um so what happens next is Rome is founded by twins uh Ramlas and Remis and they will um fight for the kingship of Rome okay so can you read the story of Ramis and Remis remis is said to have been the first to receive an omen six vultures appeared to him the augury had just been announced to Rmulus when double the number appeared to him each was saluted as king by his own party the one side based their claim on the priority of the appearance the other on the number of the birds then followed an angry altercation heated passions led to bloodshed in their turmoil Rez was killed the more common report is that Remis contemptuously jumped over the newly raised walls and was forth killed by the enraged Romulus who exclaimed "So shall it be henceforth with everyone who leaves over my walls." Romulus thus became sole ruler and the city was called after him its founder so Ramos and Remis are twins okay they love each other and um Rome was founded on violence okay that's the very nature of Rome a city based on violence this story if you remember um sorry okay so so now Rome founds a city called Rome and he invites anyone to join him and over time they become much more powerful and they threaten their neighboring states and they cannot and these states cannot defeat Rome in war so what they decide is you know what we can't beat the Romans in battle but if our daughters don't marry into them they'll be dead after one generation they they won't have any children okay so there's this compact among the nations of Italy not to marry into Rome so Romans discover this and they hatch this plan what they're going to do is they're going to have this major festival and they're going to invite all the families to come to this festival and then um they will kidnap a woman and rape them okay that's the plan okay they were invited to accept hospitality at the different houses and after examining the situation of the city its walls and the large number of dwelling houses included they were astonished at the rapidity with which the Roman state had grown when the hour for the games had come and their eyes and minds were alike raveted on the spectacle before them the preconert the preconer signal was given and the Roman youth dashed in all directions to carry off the maidens who were present the larger part were carried off indiscrim indiscriminately but some particular beautiful girls who had been marked out of the leading patricians were carried to their houses by plebeians told off the tad off for the task alarm and concernation broke up the games and the parents of the maidens fled distracted with grief uttering bitter reproaches on the violators of the laws of hospitality and appealing to the god who to whose solemn games they had come only to be the victims of impious perity okay so this is actually a very serious crime because when you invite people into your house there are these laws that um you must show uh hospitality to your guests otherwise you will offend the gods themselves because it's possible the person you invite into your house is a god himself okay so what the Romans did was outrageous okay the abduct maidens were quite as despondent and indignant rmulus however went round in person and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying rights of inner marriage to their neighbors they would live in honorable wedlock and share all their property and civil rights and dearest of all to human nature would be the mothers of free men he begged them to lay aside their feelings of resentment and give their affections to whose to those whom fortune had made masters of their persons and injury had often led to reconcilation and love they would find their husbands all the more affectionate because each would do his utmost so far as in him lay to make up for the loss of parents and country these arguments were reinforced by endearments of the h other husbands who excused their conduct by pleading the irresistible force of their passion a plea effective beyond all other and appealing to a woman's nature okay so the are pretty disgusting okay they rape a woman said it's your fault or it's your parents' fault and I really couldn't control myself so sorry man but I'll be nice to you okay yep all right so this this is um a pretty um memorable event in Roman history it's called the rape of the Sabian woman okay and these are different artworks deping depicting the event okay um so the fathers are obviously pissed about about this okay so a huge army is created to rescue the woman back and now these these Roman soldiers are now facing this huge army and when this happens as about the the clash these women who are raped they come screaming forward in the middle and say "Stop stop stop you're you're my husband you're my father we don't want you to fight." Okay uh can you read please then it was that the Sabian women whose wrongs had led to the war throwing off all womenish fears in their distress went boldly into the midst of the flying missiles with de deceived deceived hair and red garment running across the space between the two armies they tried to stop any further fighting and calm the excited passions by appealing to their fathers in the one army and their husbands in the other not to bring upon themselves a curse by staining their hands with the blood of a father-in-law or son-in-law nor upon their posterity the taint of paris parasid parasite parasite if they cried you are wary of these ties of kindred these marriage bonds then turn your anger upon us it It is we who are the cause of the war it is we It was we who had wounded and slain our husbands and fathers better for us to perish rather than live without one or the other of few as widows or as orphans the armies and their leaders were alike moved by this appeal there was a sudden hush and silence then the generals advanced to arrange the terms of a treaty it was not only peace that was made the two nations were united into one state the royal powers was shared between them and the seat of government for both nations was Rome okay so this could possibly happen right so these women are abducted the fathers try to rescue them and then the women say "Hey it was our fault like let's just all be one big family." Okay so this this is one of the founding myths of Rome and I and I keep on saying this but like just take all Roman history and just like throw it in the garbage okay because it's it's basically all made up all right so um Rome built becomes more and more powerful and now they have a king okay but over time their king becomes very corrupt uh their king is superbut superb bus just means arrogant and his son falls in love with a noble woman named Lucricia but Lucricia is already married to a man named uh Kentinius and so this the prince decides to go you know rape her okay and yeah okay they found Lucriccia sitting in her room prostrate with grief as they entered she burst into tears and to her husband's inquiry whether all was well replied "No what can be well with a woman when her honor is lost the marks of a stranger collad colinus caladeness are in your bed but it is only the body that have been violated the soul is pure death shall bear witness to that but pledge me your solemn word that the adulter shall not go unpunished it is sexist harquin who coming as an enemy instead of a guest forced from me last night by brutal violence a pleasure fatal to me and if you're a man fatal to him they all successively pledged their word and tried to console the distracted women by turning the guilt from the victim of the outrage to the perpetrator and urging that it is the mind that sins not the body and where there has been no consent there is no guilt it is for you she said to see that he gets in deserts although I equip myself to the sin I do not free myself from the penalty no untasted woman shall henceforth live and plead Lucricia's example she had a knife concealed in her dress which she plunged into her heart and fell dying on the floor her father and husband raised the death cry okay so she is raped by the prince and um her husband and best friend uh the best friend is Lucius Brhus okay they try to console her and they know she's distraught okay but but Lucia is like "No I don't be consoled i want I want revenge." We're Romans man we fight to the bitter end if you hit me I go kill you if you kill me I go kill the entire family okay and that's just a Roman way so what happens is like Brutus Lucius Brhes he leads a revolt against the king and the king is forced out of Rome and um now Rome is a republic it's it's now run by the nobility and a lot of people aren't happy with this system because before if you're good friends with a king you can do whatever you want but now you have to follow the laws of Rome and so people conspire against the new um republic and a couple of the conspirators include two of Lucius Buddhist sons okay his two sons and the conspirators is found out and all the conspirators are arrested and they're condemned to death lucius Buddhist decides he's going to put his own sons to death so he orders and organizes the assa the execution of his two sons okay their punishment created a great sensation owing to the fact that the cons c consular office imposed upon a father the duty of inflicting punishment on his own children he who ought not to have witnessed it was destined to be the one to see it do duly carried out youths belonging to the noblest families were standing tied to the post but all eyes were turned to the consil's children the others were unnoticed men did not grieve more for their punishment than for their crime which had incurred it that they should have conceived the idea in that in that in that year above all of betraying to one who had been a ruthless tyrant and was now an exile and an enemy a newly liberated country their father who had liberated it the consil ship which had originated in the junian hoon junian house the senate the plebs all the Rome possessed of human or divine the consils took their seats the listenitor uh victors were told off to inflict the penalty they scourged their bearbacks with rods and then beheaded them during the whole time the father's countenance betrayed his feelings but the father's stern resolution was still more apparent as he superintended the public execution so you're a father right and these are your two sons you love your two sons more than anything else in the world you are forced by the law to execute your two sons okay now most fathers would be like you know what i'm going to call in sick i'm I'm going to go home and sleep until my sons are are dead lucas Buddhist is like "No I'm going to actually watch my two sons get killed." Not only that but I'm going to organize their execution okay and we can imagine okay this is Lucas Buddhist and he has to watch as his sons are being beheaded right before him and he's the one ordering their their um execution as you can see people are disgusted they have to look away and people are looking at his expression and you can see the emotional turmoil in his face right there's hatred there's disgust there's contempt there's guilt he hates himself right he hates his son but he hates himself even more there's all this um crazy energy hateful energy that's being unleashed the Roman way is take all this energy and turn it against your enemy okay that's a secret of the Roman military to create a society so hateful so angry so vicious that people have all this demonic energy in them that they can now use against your enemy okay so let's see what happens what's going to happen now is the king decides to attack Rome because this conspira conspiracy has failed right what Lucius Buddhist is going to do is ride out and meet the army head on okay can you read please so two armies from these cities followed Tarun to recover his crown and cha chastised the Romans when they had entered the Roman territory the consoles advanced against them val Valyrias with the infant infantry and Fallon's information uh formation brutus recon reconing reconetrying in advance with the cavalry similarly the enemy's calvary was in front of his main body Areronus Tarkin the king's son in command the king himself followed with the legionnaires whilst still at a distance Aaron distinguished the console by his escort of list licers as they drew nearer he clearly recognized Brutes by his features and in a transport of rage exclaimed "That is the man who drove us from our country see him proudly advancing adorned with our insignia ye God Avengers of kings aid me." With these words he dug spurs into his horse and rode straight at the console brutus saw that he was making for him it was a point of honor in those days for the leaders to engage in single combat so he eagerly accepted the challenge and they charged with such fury neither of them thinking of protecting himself if only he could wound his foe that each drove his spear at the same moment through the other's shield and they fell dying from their horses with their spears sticking in them okay so you see what happened okay so Prudence is traumatized by the execution of his two sons there is now a void in his heart there is now a tear in his heart right but this tear is unleashing all this energy that he can now use against his enemy okay that is a secret trauma is a drug the Roman ways use trauma as as a drug to empower you against your enemies okay all right so um the problem though is that um the Roman army is much smaller than the king's army so Romans are forced back into their city they have to hide behind their walls and they're under siege and there's a Roman noble man named Mousius and Mousius decides to offer a proposal to the Senate he says to the Senate "Listen we're never going to beat this king's army what what I can do is I can sneak into his camp and assassinate the king and so the Senate is like "Sure." So Mushi swims across the Tyber and he sneaks in into an enemy camp and he sees it's payday okay so So there's two men uh the king and secretary giving out cash giving out money to the soldiers and they they look the same they dress the same and Musas doesn't know which is which and at this point he should be like "You know what i'll come back another day and figure out who's the king." But now he's like "You know what it's 50/50 you know it's a coin flip." So he takes his dagger and he stabs the guy and it turns out to be the secretary and he's arrested okay and he appears before the king and he and the king says to him "You tell me the truth or I will burn you in this fire." And then Mushia says "Okay the truth is this i am one of hundreds of young Roman men who have sworn to come and kill you one of us will succeed i failed today but tomorrow someone else will come and if you fail someone else will come as well and then um the king says "Are you telling the truth if you are not telling the truth I will burn you alive." And then Mushius is you know what he takes his hand okay he takes his hand and he puts in a fire and his hand is being burned okay he's just like the king is freaked out he's like "You Romans are the craziest bastards you guys are demonic i'm out of here." Okay though the war is over all right all right can you read please here alone and help us and the utmost peril he was still able to inspire more fear than he felt i am a citizen of Rome he said men call me se mucous mucus as an enemy I wish to kill an enemy and I have as much courage to meet death as I had to inflict it it is the Roman nature to act bravely and to suffer bravely i'm not alone in having made this resolve against you behind me there is a long list of those who aspire to the same distinction if then it is your pleasure make make up your mind for a struggle in which you will every hour have to fight for your life and find an armed foe on the threshold of your royal tent this is the war which we the youth of Rome declared against you we have you have no sir ranks no pitch battle to fear the matter will be settled between you alone and each one of us singly the king furious with anger and at the same time terrified at the unknown danger threatened that if he did not promptly explain the nature of the plot which he was darkly hinting at he should be roasted alive oo mucus cried and learned how lightly those regards their bodies who have some great glory in view then he plunged his right hand into a fire burning on the altar whilst he kept it roasting there as if he were devoid of all sensation the king astounded at his pre international conduct sprang from his seat and ordered the youth to be removed from the altar go he said you have been a worse enemy to yourself than to me i would invoke blessings on your courage if it were displayed on behalf of my country as it is i send you away exempt from all rights of war unheers and safe the amuseiest reciprocating as it were this generous treatment said since you honor courage know that what you could not gain by threats you have obtained by kindness 300 of us the foremost amongst the Roman youth have sworn to attack you in this way the lot felt to me first the rest in the order of their lot will come each in his turn till fortune shall give us a favorable chance against you okay so the Romans are crazy okay they are demonic all right so um none of this is true okay it can't possibly be true you can't put your hand in a fire and like not feel anything okay but where this is coming from is from the uh protoindo-uropean myth remember when we discussed the steps people they had of mythology okay so what what the Romans are doing is they're taking this mythology and they are adapting it to their own history okay so everything that we've read is not true but the Romans thought it was true okay and remember people don't can cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality so as long as you think as long as you believe it is true then um it's true okay and this is how Romans behave so um um yeah so the story of Lucius Buddhist kicking out uh the Tarkkins um is the story of the third man stealing the cattle okay so basically stealing a throne from Tarquin and the story of the man sacrificing his twin is story of Romulus and Remis okay all right all right so now we get to the most famous of all um Roman ethics called the Iniad and so at this time again um Augustus Caesar has a problem in that everyone acknowledges the Greek culture be superior why because of Homer okay because of the Iliad remember we read the Iliad and we remember how uh the Iliad ends with an act of love and forgiveness and compassion right um Achilles feels guilt for for what he's done for killing Petetro he takes out this rage on Hector right which is a very which is a Roman way and then Prime comes and forgives Achilles by kissing his hand and this um allows Achilles to escape his guilt and they uh forgive each other and in the face of Pryam Achilles sees his father in the face of Achilles Pry sees Hector and so they hug and they uh weep together okay and this idea of love as a unifying force of the universe becomes the basis of Greek culture and and of Greek civilization the Romans don't like this for them if you're a culture based on hate love is the greatest enemy okay so what is going to happen is Augusta Caesar is going to ask a poet named Virgil to rewrite this story in a way that puts hate at the center of the universe and not love okay all right all right so this is the Iniad by Virgil considered one of the greatest books in human history it is a complete piece of crap okay it's propaganda all right when you read it you you see how terrible it is and uh basically Virgil who was the most famous poet in the Roman Empire at this time he's being ordered by Augustus Caesar to write the INAD and they write it together basically basically with each draft Virgil has to read it to August of Caesar and then August Caesar tells him how to rework it so it captures the Roman spirit when Virgil was um about to die he asked for the for the book to be burned okay because he as a poet understands that if you are using the gift of God poet use the gift of God to promote hatred then you're going to burn in hell man okay um so he asked to for this book to be burned but August Caesar no no I like it the way it is okay so this is a rewriting of the Iliad what's going to happen is this the Greeks have broken into Troy and they're killing everyone okay and the son of Achilles uh named Pyrus is killing the sons of Pryam and Pry faces uh Pyrus and he tells Pyrus "You're the son of Achilles achilles was a noble person have you no mercy?" And then like no and then he kills pirate pry okay all right so can you read please suddenly look a son a son of Pry Pry my bad pry polites just escaped from slaughters as pyrus hands comes racing in through spears through enemy fighters fleeing down the long arcades and deserted hallways badly wounded pirates hot on his heels a weapon poised for the kill about to seize him about to run him through and pressing pressing home as polites reaches his parents and collapses vomiting out his life bloodl before their eyes okay so this is very similar to the death of Hector right so remember Achilles kills Hector and Prime witnesses it right and um something is happening here where Polites is being killed in front of Prime so again it's a rewriting of the Iliad keep on going at that Prime trapped in the grip of death not holding back not checking his words his rage you he cries and you and your vicious crimes if any power on high recoils at such an outrage let the gods repay you for all your reckless work grant you the thanks the rich reward you've earned you've made me see my son's death with my own eyes def def defiled a father's sight with a son's lifeblood you say you're Achilles son you lie achilles never treated enemy pri so no he honored he honored as suppliance right he blushed to betray my trust he restored my Hector's bloodless corpse for burial sent me safely home to the land I rule okay so this is the end of the Iliad okay so he's reminding everyone the Iliad is a story about love forgiveness compassion okay with that and with all his might the old man fling his spear but too important how to pierce it merely graced Fire's brazen shield that blocks its way and clings there dangling limp from the boss all for nothing pyrus shouts back "Well then down you go a messenger to my father Pelia's son tell him about my vicious work how neo Neoptoamus neopalamus degrades his father's name don't you forget now die that said he dragged the old man straight to the altar quaking slithering on through slicks of his son's blood and twisting Pry's hair in his left hand his right hand sweeping forth his sword a flash of steel he buries it hill deep in the king's flank such was the fate of Piriam his death his slot on earth with Choi blazing before his eyes her ramparts down the monarch who once had ruled in all his glory the many land of Asia Asia's many tribes a powerful trunk is lying on the shore the head wrenched from the shoulders a corpse without a name okay so all Roman school children have to memorize this poetry and obviously if you are a Roman school child and you know that pry is from your ancestors you have a deep hatred of the Greeks okay so the entire purpose of the Iniad is to create hatred of the Greeks in order to create a Roman identity all right so again the Greeks were the greatest civilization we ever had why because they were a civilization based on reflection on debate on openness this is um a modern reenactment of the play the Trojan woman okay this is a play by Eupites that discusses what happens to the children woman after Troy falls they become enslaved the children are killed and so the Greeks when they watch this play they have to watch their own darkness they have to see for themselves their own heart of darkness it causes tremendous empathy for their enemies okay this is the very idea of civilization and what do the Romans do they do this okay gladiators they watch lions eat people they watch men kill each other okay that's the Roman way the Greeks want to understand and feel empathy for other people the Romans just want to kill other people all right um and in America today we have a very similar Roman culture as well this is American football of course and um it is pretty violent okay it is pretty barbaric all right the Greeks for fun what the elite do is they organize dinner parties called symposia symposium um and in the symposium what happens is that people come together and they have conversations about love about poetry about life they will drink wine but the wine is watered down okay so they can keep on drinking for a long long time the entire argument is just to have a conversation all right all right and so this is the idea of the symposium okay this is a famous painting of Alabades coming in and having discussion with everyone so in Athenian culture what's important is to be a great speaker to be intelligent to engage people in debate and conversation and philosophy okay and what do the Romans do instead um they get drunk and they throw up and they have orgies okay so the R woman what women super fun is they have these huge feasts these huge banquetss and what they will do is they will go on the food in the first course they go outside and throw up okay they will throw up the food so they can they can join the second course they will w down the food and then go and throw up again okay and guys this is while people on the streets starving to death okay okay this is u the Roman way okay so this is um the feast this is almost a reenactment of the rape of Sabian woman right so they take um these myths so uh the death of Lucricia uh Mus burning his hand the rape of the Sabbian woman and they use it as entertainment for the societies okay so this this is really the beginning of secret societies right all right so what secret societies do is they will take these myths and reenact them out in order to build sol um solidarity and trust and cohesion among the secret members um this is a picture of Nero just getting drunk having a lot of sex okay so it's pretty it's it's pretty pointless existence and of course in America you have this um I don't understand why is it that people think it's fun to do drugs get get drunk and then go party all night okay but u apparently it's it's supposed to be a lot of fun okay all right so that is Roman culture so Rome becomes the dominant empire at this time and it is an empire based on hatred and it seems life is hopeless and so what will happen is the universe will send a messenger to remind people there's still hope because there's God in you and this person's name is Jesus right so we'll discuss Jesus next class okay so Jesus's response to the Roman Empire so I'll I'll take some quick questions um from YouTube and then and then we'll end the class okay all right so what does it mean to be a great man okay so I say that love is unifying force of the universe but then you have these great men who come and conquer people so which is which okay um so um in my in my understanding of things port prophets are the greatest men okay people like Zorustra uh Homer Jesus uh these are the the Yahweh in the Bible these are the great individuals of human history issue because they represent the truth okay they are messengers of the Monad and then you have people like Julius Caesar Alexand the Great Napoleon who do a lot of conquering okay um and they have been identified as great men of history but I think it's really Homer and Dante and Plato who are the greatest people because they create civilizations based on their ideas they actually change the course of human history based on on their ideas whereas people like Napoleon Julius Caesar Exen the Great they're more like a culmination of the trajectory of human history okay if that makes any sense all right uh let's move on all right um yeah so the great head so what did the Iliad mean to the great okay so um to understand this idea think of a play okay we all want to put on a play we all know a script but we need an actor to play a certain character and then we're like you know what Azen the Great plays Achilles okay so it's expected that a great will behave the way of Achilles in the Iliad how did Achilles behave achilles saw himself as a young romantic hero he was going to die in the beaches of Troy in order to achieve eternal glory okay that's why Ezin the Great could not stop fighting the war in every battle he was leading the charge because he wanted to die in battle he wanted to be Achilles only by dying in battle could he achieve the fame of Achilles okay so um he was acting out the play what's what's important is that he himself saw himself as the reincarnation of Achilles and everyone else saw him as also the uh personification of Achilles as well okay so that's how this works all right um this person asks why is it that Denmark Norway these Scandinavian countries are so different from other countries okay well first of all they're small okay they're really small countries millions of people everyone knows each other if you go to Denmark everyone knows the prime minister of Denmark maybe she was their neighbor or their friend if they don't know the prime minister then they know a friend who know who knows the prime minister so it's a really small place okay that builds cohesion that's number one number two is guys Denmark Norway are really cold places that means that people spend a lot of time indoors together talking and becoming friends okay and also because it's so cold they have to work together the third factor is these countries are surrounded by lots of dangerous enemies germany Russia um Sweden okay and as such they learn that it's really important to stick together and to work together now what's interesting is that if you go to a place like Holland you go and you think it's very egalitarian but what's really interesting is that it's actually one of the most unequal places on earth because the aristocrats have a lot of money but the but the problem is the difference is like the aristocrats understand like if the people are happy they're more safe okay so the aristocrats will actually uh u promote and support the welfare state because of social cohesion okay all right um a couple questions um so we are moving to the age of digital technology artificial intelligence does it mean that empires will change over time um okay this is something that I will discuss towards the end of the semester to the end of this course and it's a really interesting idea where okay you're an empire you're lazy arrogant and stupid but maybe with artificial intelligence you have more control over people and in theory that's true okay once you have the AI system more you you'll be able to control people better but f but you have to first build the AI system and that takes a lot of effort and energy and if you're in d empire like America you don't have the energy to build this AI system okay what you do have is a lot of um desire and motivation to create an AI scam okay so chatbt is a scam guys it's not really doing anything but you can actually take this technology and create like a matrix to enslave people psychologically mentally okay we'll discuss discuss this towards the end of the semester we call this transhumanism all right all right um Okay okay so Athenians and Spartans were didn't want to destroy each other but that led to the rise of Macedonia how did that happen the answer is because they didn't care okay do you understand they're the empire so they think they're invincible if an empire believed that a challenge challenge could could arise they would never ever fall guys if an empire recognized that it could fall one day it would never ever fall it's because of hubris because it's so arrogant lazy and stupid that it falls okay so it's impossible for either Athens or or Sparta to imagine that Macedonia would one day overtake them all right um last question is about secret societies um how do secret societies work all right so this is something that we will discuss towards the end of the course okay but why is it that secret societies are so powerful all right to understand this let's just do a thought experiment all right so imagine this there's four groups of 100 people each okay and there's this huge mountain the Himalayas and the task is to get get everyone to the top as soon as possible okay as quickly as possible there are four teams okay team one is like you guys can do whatever you want okay we don't care team two is like if everyone gets to the top you get a million dollars each right team three is one of the team members has a child who's going to die unless you get to the top because at the top is this magic doctor who can save your son okay that's team three team four is there are these demons that are chasing you and they will you won't be able to sleep you won't be able to live in peace if you don't stop running from these demons okay so guess what team one team two team three team four who wins team four obviously right not secret societies secret societies create so much trauma they create so much guilt and hatred and contempt that they're forced to keep on moving and running okay that's the Roman way guys okay remember loses Brutus he killed his own two sons what do you do after that well you have to go kill someone else okay and then after you kill him what do you do you go kill someone else and you keep on going because the guilt of killing your own two sons it's too much to bear if you just stop and you rest your sons will appear before you as ghost and like they'll be like "Dad why did you kill us what did we do what did you kill us?" You cannot bear that guilt so you have to keep on moving forward you rush forward okay even if it kills you all right so so at this time we have so much guilt you either conquer the world or you kill yourself your choice and that's why secret sites are so powerful guys okay not because they have secrets okay i I actually don't know if they have secrets or not all right but I imagine they don't have secrets but I imagine like they do so much evil in the world that they can only do more evil in order to escape the evil that they've already done okay it's as though demons are chasing them does that make sense guys yes all right so questions so I think I did not fully understand the part which the romance rape of those womens and women's blame the sins on themselves think that part I think it's a bit confusing I think okay so um first of all you need to understand all this woman history is nonsense okay none of it is true these all just mythologies to create the woman character Okay so the rape of the sab woman um didn't really happen but what the custom is if I go kill you I kill you and I steal your wife okay so so so it is a metaphor for war that does that make sense okay okay and um but what what this is saying is like if you go and kill your enemy and you steal his wife the wife will thank you all right so it's creating this mythology all right but why would the wife thank you like you the wife won't thank you the wife will hate you but do you care not you don't care okay the winners write the history do you understand when you become a slave you are not allowed to speak you're not allowed to think for yourself you have to do whatever the man tells you to do right does that make sense mhm so even though you feel hate for the man who's killed your family you're now a slave so if you lost your soul and if you lost your soul it means I can do whatever I want to your mind as well as your body okay so this is the Roman way and guys um it's no different from any empire that emerged after the Romans okay the British Empire is the same way the American Empire is the same way as well in that if we conquer you we can now implant anything into your soul because your soul is now ours okay so if you go to Germany and you see what's you talk to Germans the Germans will tell you "Oh we are the worst people in the world we're the most evil people in the world we did the Holocaust we started World War I we started World War II if you give us any like opportunity we'll start wars for no reason." Okay you go to Japan same thing okay so the winners write the history and the losers have to accept this history okay does that make sense any more questions guys um I remember when you were talking about Julius Caesar you said the the only reason why he survived was because or like survived the Holocaust uh not the Holocaust but like um uh people in Rome were being killed I think and he was able to survive because his father had a lot of money had a lot of wealth but you also mentioned that he was a part of the populace so how does that add up okay yeah that's a good question okay so to remind you okay the conflict arises between upper nobility and lower nobility so upper nobility are just the optimist people like I have all the power lower nobility are the children who are like I want the status okay so so yes Julius Caesar did come from a very wealthy family but he didn't have status okay okay so money and status are not the same thing and that that's why there's a civil wars because the people who were part of elite aren't able to access power so they scheme on how to access power so look at Donald Trump okay donald Trump has money but he doesn't have power that's why he ran for the for presidency okay does it does it make sense okay so remember all these conflicts that happen in the world are always between upper nobility and low nobility between the have a lot and the have some but want some more okay it's never between rich and poor the poor don't do anything okay the the poor just like I'm poor i'm useless i'll just sit and die okay that's that's what poor people are like middle class people rich people are like you know I want more okay they're aspirational is that clear okay but I think if the middle class like if they want more the more higher class they will not allow the middle class to they won't allow them to have more like they will suppress them yeah and that's what creates a French revolution okay oh all right all right any any more questions guys okay great so remember this is the Roman Empire we've done the Roman Empire and it's an empire based on hate and people's lives under the Roman Empire it's just terrible there's massive slavery there's massive debt there's massive corruption and so now we'll emerge um another poet prophet named Jesus to try to redeem people okay so we'll discuss Jesus next class
