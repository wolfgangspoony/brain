okay so let's start class today we are doing the Bronet collapse so let's review where we are in history okay so remember the four earlier civilizations are Egypt Mesop Mesopotamia uh Inis Valley and of course China and as we discussed the reason why the four they are the first four major civilizations is that they have major rivers that allow them to develop agriculture as well as trade overseas and as we discussed what will happen is that they will have a major city and this major city will have colonies along the major river okay so in Egypt it's the Nile in Mesopotamia it is the uh Euphrates and the Tigris and the first city is Eur China it's the yellow river right um so in this valley is in this valley uh is the Indis river and and now these different city states will go to war in order to control trade routes and this leads to a time of major innovation in human history at the same time because of these wars wars they need better and better equipment and so eventually they will develop bronze okay bronze bronze as you know is an alloy of tin and copper so you need both in order to create bronze which is the strongest metal it's ideal for shields for armor and for swords and whoever has more bronze weaponry will win any war the problem though is that tin it's actually hard to mine and to discover and to ask of it into to manufacture in fact tin deposits are scattered all around the world okay so this is tin over here over here over here and over here over here okay they're everywhere basically but it's not concentrated therefore you must now build more trade routes in order to access tin okay so what's going to happen now is that more trade routes will develop in order to access tin and the major points the major trade routes will will become cities themselves okay all right and now this world is globalized in order to facilitate warfare now what's interesting is the Indis Valley itself it's not like Egypt Mesopotamia and China it is not engaged in warfare we've done archaeology in the Indis Valley in modern day Pakistan we we have not discovered weaponry okay we've we've discovered bronze but we have not discovered weaponry in fact we believe that in this valley it is a peaceful egalitarian and artistic civilization but it's still brought into this global system why because bronze changes from weaponry into status okay um meaning people use it for pottery for jewelry and then eventually what happens is that bronze itself becomes capital all right now what we also know is that this world is heavily globalized there's a lot of trading and this and this world is complete meaning it um touches every corner of the world but starting in about the year 1200 this system collapses in fact the collapse is sudden and devastating so remember in if you know Chinese history you will know that this is the Shan dynasty right guess what guys about the year 1200 it collapses all right and we know this because Egypt is under attack during this time by by the sea peoples and what we believe is that the sea peoples are actually refugees who are fleeing the destruction of Europe what we believe is that there's a perfect storm engulfing this world at this time okay so this perfect storm includes climate change climate change leads to drought which leads to famine which leads to a migration crisis what's going to happen is that the sea peoples are going to come in um from the north and they are going to wipe out existing civilizations including Masonian Greece and the Hitite Empire okay the Highite Empire which is in um Anatolia which is in modern day Turkey why Mason Greece and the high tide empire are important is we believe they are the two major antagonists in the Trojan War you may have heard of the Trojan War well guess where guess what troy is here okay so Troy is in the center of global trade and that's why people fight over the location of the city so the Messian Greece is being destroyed the high tide empire is being destroyed and Egypt is being under attack egypt will survive the invasions of the sea peoples but after the um invasions Egypt will be exhausted and will it will lose its um global power status okay um in this valley will be itself overwhelmed from because of refugees fleeing in from the steps okay mesopotamia and it's very interesting about Mesopotamia but it's actually the most resilient of all the four major civilizations and the reason why is Mesopotamia throughout its history is constantly at war okay so Egypt is protected by natural geography by the desert the Sarah desert and then by um the Red Sea okay so Egypt has natural boundaries uh China also has natural boundaries but Mopinia does not it's a flat land so it's very easy for the mountain people to come invade um and it's very easy for outsiders to come and build new empires in fact um throughout Mesopotamian history there have been three major empires the Aadian Empire the Babylonian Empire and the Assyrian Empire and it goes back and forth and these empires are not um they don't really last that long maybe maybe a couple hundred years at most because this area is so competitive but because it's so competitive it's actually much more resilient than the other areas okay all right so again the big question for us is why would this world collapse like this all of a sudden and it's really relevant for us to understand because many scholars have compared the bronze age world to our world because our world is also one that is heavily globalized um and it seems like it's on the verge of collapse so why is it that this sort of like globalized world in which many countries are getting very wealthy why do they collapse all of a sudden okay and the argument I will make to you today is it has to do with the nature of capital okay so what I will show you is that this is a protoc capitalistic system and what we know about protocism is that it allows for rapid growth but then it also allows for rapid collapse okay so let's go over the idea of capital what is capital okay so capital has three major characteristics okay the first is that it is universal universal just means that everyone wants it everyone in the world believes it has value okay that's number one number two is that it is a store of value and what this what this means is that you're able to take wealth and store it inside this commodity okay and the third thing about capital that's very important is it's mobility okay mobility meaning I can take this thing and then transport to somewhere else at little or no cost if it has these three characteristics then it is capital okay and throughout human history there have been different types of capital um so let's let's look over at some examples so one example is grain right just food um grain is sort of universal because everyone wants to eat but not everyone thinks it's valuable okay okay and it's hard to store value in grain because it could uh decompose easily right and it's actually hard to transport grain because it's cheap but it's expensive to transport okay and that's why grain never became capital now let's look at cattle cattle like cows and sheep um it's a better form of capital because you can store more value um and it could be universal but it's actually hard to transport and that's why cattle never became capital okay now if you keep on moving on you get into slaves right human beings and so you can have woman slaves sex slaves you can also have man labor okay and this is a better form of capital because it's sort of universal okay um you can store value in it but the value is uncertain or unstable um and it's and it's mobile okay so slaves became an economy but this is a very base um basic economy then you develop bronze okay and bronze now is extremely valuable okay everyone wants it so it's universal you can store a lot of value in it because it's it's hard to make and now you can move it around okay so in other words branch became the first real universal currency in the world and this allowed for rapid globalization in the world so think of the the equivalent of branch today is of course the US dollar right the US dollar is universal everyone wants it um it's a store of value and it's mobile as well and so it's a US dollar which allows for the rapid growth of capitalism around the world okay now let's discuss why how capital works all right so what we know is that we humans are actually uh composed of two natures we are composed of an altruistic nature and we are composed of a utilitarian nature okay ultruistic just means that you care about human relationships you want to be nice to people because you want to you want to be their friends they're part of your family okay unitarian just means that you don't care about others you just care about the goal the profit money power okay and we're composed of both sides so think about when you go to a restaurant right if the meal is good you pay a lot of money for it and you give the waitress a tip when you go home to dinner and your mother is happy to see you your mother cooks you a really nice meal and then you say thank you right you don't want to do the opposite right where you go to a restaurant and you're like "Thank you." And then you leave and you don't want to go to your mother's houses and like say to your mother "Hey this meal was fantastic here's $1,000 for you." Okay it would go up okay we have two different natures and we keep them separate what capital does that's very interesting is that it moves us from the altruistic state into the utitarian state and at first that's good why because when you're altruistic you don't really want to do anything okay because you don't you don't want to offend other people so there are lots of um villages in the world and they're static why because for them what matters is not change what matters is harmony in this religious it kind of sucks to be an outsider it kind of sucks to stand out in fact there are some traditions in which if you are outspoken if you are thoughtful if you like to explore if you're curious they will kill you and make you a sacrifice to the gods because they see you as a threat to their social system okay so an altruistic system it is um it doesn't like change so if you don't do anything to it it just stays the way it is so when you bring capital people now are more motivated to work hard people are more motivated to innovate and to explore so at first this is good okay now you're expanding the system but and then you reach a point of its um maximum growth but then what happens is the scale sorry the um the scale tips over okay and people become too utarian and when you become too utitarian you cheat you are um you don't care about others and this causes a lot of problems okay you start to exploit other people and so when you become too utilitarian the system collapses right does that make sense capital comes in the system and it makes it grow really fast once it hits a certain point then um it has to collapse okay so let's use another example let's just say that you are a leader of a group of people and it could be a village you could be anywhere okay and um if there's no money involved what do you care about you care about status you care about your reputation you care about how other people see and perceive you right so you care about the feelings of others once capital enters the equation then then the way that the leader sees you is different the leader sees you as a commodity to be exploited okay the leader is not like how much money can I make money off you not only that but the leader okay the leader will do what the leader will align with other leaders and they will become a cartel okay or an elite and they will together exploit people okay but not only that but they will expand and look for new areas to conquer okay because all they care about now is money how to expand the capital but once you the capital expends too far then what happens is only a few people have all the capital and the people down below they're enslaved they're exploited and they want to destroy the system they become indifferent if you force them they will revolt against you so the system must collapse okay so the argument I'm trying to make to you is this is just the way capital works and there's nothing you can do about it okay that's why the bronze age grew but that's also why the bronze age collapsed and that's why our world grew but this is also why our world will collapse as well okay that's argument I'm making you to you today any questions before we go to the PPT is this clear to you guys all right let's go to the PPT all right so um this is a map that shows you the world of the Bronze Age and as we discussed um these are the four major civilizations right China in this valley uh Mesopotamia and Egypt okay and they now because they're at war they have an insatiable need for bronze and where and bronze needs tin where's tin located tin is located where the stars are okay and you can see they're scattered over the place so what they're going to do now is they're going to build build trade routes into these tin places that that allow them to extract the tin to build to create bronze armor okay but when they do so they also create new civilizations and new cities until you get a completely globalized world um so this is this is China and as you can see um they're always at war and so they need weapons okay um this is pottery bronze pottery from China during the Shang dynasty during the Bronze Age all right so how do we know that it's a completely globalized world because over the past 20 years we've discovered shipwrecks okay so we've discovered ships that um were transporting goods during the Bronze Age and so when you dig up these ships and you analyze where the products are from you're able to rebuild the trade networks okay and that's why we know about the bronze age okay so what's going to happen is this the green is the copper sources okay and as you can see there's a lot of copper sources the problem is the tin sources are spread out so in order to create bronze you need to constantly expand your trade networks outside okay and as you can see what's happening is that the expansion keeps on going until it encompass the entire world so the dark brown is the earliest trade routes and then the pink um are the later trade routes but as you can see it's always expanding outwards in order to facilitate more and more trade and what's really important for us to understand is the entire world is encompassed okay so this is Britain this is Ireland this is Scandinavia okay this is important because if you study history um it's the the British Isles Scandinavia are aren't often discussed during um in the Bronze Age but recent research has has shown us that it's all interconnected okay okay so as I mentioned these are trade networks okay and what and these um um gray spots are areas that are major nodes in the trade network they come about because of trade the red are the major consumption areas okay so the gray are areas that are being created in order to bit better facilitate trade um and eventually you reach a point when it's completely globalized when every source of copper and tin has been discovered and there's a massive trade network built around each area okay all right but again as we know even though this area is extremely globalized extremely wealthy only in about 50 years it completely collapses okay right and we know because of the Egyptian records okay the Egyptians write about the coming of the sea peoples and so if you just watch the Eros okay this the movement of the sea peoples these are refugees fleeing famine and what do they do well they team up with pirates okay and the pirates and the refugees together overwhelm existing civilizations including including the Masonans okay present day Greece including the Hitat Empire present day uh Turkey um and they keep on attacking okay even from the south people are attacking the major cities this is a this is a world in complete collapse okay um this is another map showing the invasions okay these again are the sea people these are just economic migrants these are refugees similar to what's happening today where if you're following the news in Europe you've got all these Middle Eastern uh refugees coming into Europe overwhelming their economic systems so this is a trend that we can expect to continue for a very long time okay all right the sea peoples are just a mix of different people we've tried to identify where they come come from who they are we really don't know okay so the assumption is they come from everywhere and they are being led by pirates who are expert at raiding other nations okay and this this is a painting from Egypt and again we know because the Egyptians Egyptians left records of the invasions of sea people there were at least three major invasions of sea people we're talking like hundred thousands of people attacking Egypt at the same time and Egypt had to expand tremendous resources to repel these invasions but it ultimately left Egypt bankrupt okay um this is Eric Klein he's anthropologist at the University of Washington he wrote a book called 17 1177 okay and he lists um the reasons why the Bronze Age collapse happened and he he says it was a perfect storm of crisis including climate change which led to drought which led to famine there were also earthquakes we're able to um do analysis and discover that there were major earthquakes during this time uh um there were revolutions there were civil wars there was a migration crisis okay so it's a perfect storm of crisis but what I want to show show you today is it all has to do with the nature of capital okay this is a protocolistic system all right so my argument to you to today is yes the branches collapsed because of a perfect storm of crisis that's what we know but I want to extend this and say it has to do with the fact that it was a protocolistic system and so capital drives you to prosperity but then it can all but it will also drive you to crisis okay that's the argument I will make you to you today all right and we've seen this before so this is the world right before World War I as you can see it was heavily heavily globalized okay and people thought that because of trade because of prosperity we can't go to war because why would we and then you know a couple years later World War I where tens of millions of people died for no reason okay tens of millions of people died for no reason it was it was just a slaughter and what I'm what I want to argue to you is that this is a very common thing and if you look at the broad collapse in World War I we are in a very similar situation where the world is heavily globalized it's heavily interconnected and but because of the nature of capital we'll probably fall off the edge at some point okay and and people would argue that we're already reaching this point okay so again um during the Bronze Age okay the the high bronze age the late bronze age 1400 to 1200 B.CE you can see this entire world is interconnected and what you will also see is at the center of this world is really the Mediterranean and the J and A GNC okay and which city is the most important strategically in this world it's called this city Troy right troy which is why we have the Trojan War we will discuss actually the Trojan War um next class okay but I I point this out to you okay so why is this why is this happening well think about how in a protocolistic system that depends on tin and copper how do you make money okay well there are different ways the first way you can make money is mining guess what it sucks because it's hard work and you don't make that much money out of it okay it's just labor another way is process it into ingots ingots are just ways to transport the tin and the copper okay you can also manufacture jewelry pottery and weapons okay that makes more money transporting it's hard work but you make more money okay another way is just piracy just steal the stuff but the best way you can make money actually is by controlling trade routes okay that's what Troy is troy Troy is a control of a trade route and so that's how you make real money during globalization okay that's why even today the Middle East is so important because the Middle East is a center of all global trade so whoever controls the Middle East controls global trade okay so remember this idea we have empires because empires really are trade routes empires are just controlled of trade routes empires back then is very different from empires today empires today would be like nation states which controls borders uh and have their own language back then empires were just a collection of different trading points okay that were aligned with each other um and the children war was just a trade war that's all it was we we'll discuss this next class okay okay so um you you can see why Troy is so important because if you're in Anatolia it's it's mainly mountains it's good because you can mine for precious metals and it's easy to defend but it's hard to access the sea that's why Troy is so important okay all right so again we know about globalization during the branches because of shipwrecks okay so this is a very famous shipwreck that we discovered off the coast of Turkey called uh Elo Bun okay and inside it you can see all this precious pottery and we can actually date the location of where the pottery came from okay so these are major sources of tin and what and what's really important this map tells you is that they're actually in mountains okay so they're hard to reach that means you have to spend a lot of effort to create trade routes based on tin okay these are ingots okay this is how you transport tin and copper you you you transform it into ingots um and what's going to happen is that because the tin is located in isolated areas and it's high mountains they have to use every form of transportation and so in Europe they mainly use the river system and that's why all of Europe is brought into this trading network this is Scandinavia and as you can see there's a lot of trade focused on Scandinavia as well okay okay and this is something that we've we've not known before we just assume that Scand didn't actually actually exist back then it did exist okay um and it was it's a very important part of the trade network okay so let's talk about the Indis Valley civilization um the Indis Valley civilization for the longest time we know was peaceful egotarian and religious and we know because we're able to dig up their cities and what we discovered is that it's very much similar to Kak Hoyak where the housings are is very similar where irrigation where hygiene it's all very advanced and we have no evidence of warfare because we can't find any weaponry okay so um why is in this valley so peaceful as compared to Egypt Mesopotamia and China i think it was because they were able to trade with Mesopotamia China and Egypt and discovered we don't want this system we don't want a system where everyone's killing each other okay that's my guess but but I I don't know no one knows okay this is um one of the In Valley's major cities that we've dug up this is another as you can see it's pretty advanced the houses are pretty equal it's very similar to Katy Hoyek okay a much bigger version of Kat Hoyek which which we discussed previously this is an artist re rendition of what Inis Valley City would look like during that time okay what's amazing is that it's very advanced it's very hygienic it's very peaceful it's very egalitarian and religion was a major part of their lives during this time okay um so the indic civilization will also give rise to something called the Bmac culture okay and this is in actually North Afghanistan um and uh how this developed was because of trade right because as I discussed previously tin is found in the mountains and so you need you need to create a community around the the mountain um so it's a mining town but it's also for manufacturing it's also for transportation it's also for trade so this is a pretty um sophisticated pretty complex area but o but over time what will happen is that um the mima culture will bring people from the steps okay these are the protoindouropeans we discussed previously and then because of climate change because of the collapse of branches they will come and they will occupy both modern day Iran as well as India giving rise to two religions the zorastan religion as well as the Hindu religion we'll discuss this um at a later date okay this is pottery from that uh in this valley civilization okay uh let's move on to the Mian civilization okay the Mian civilization is really important because it gives us Greek civilization okay which is considered the birthplace of all western civilization we'll discuss the Greeks next class and specifically but I will I will introduce the Manians now okay Masonia is in the center um we believe that the Msian culture it is a warrior aristocracy so the people in charge are warriors as opposed to a priest aristocracy okay so remember in Sumer it was the priests that were in control now it's a warriors who are in control and we also know that the Msian people are descendants of the protoindo-uropeans okay so the protoinduropeans indoor Europeans swept in into Europe uh and then they went all the way down to Greece okay um and as you can see Masania is really important because it's a center of all trade at this time in history the easiest way to get around the Mediterranean is by sea okay land it's very costly um it's very slow and there's lots of bandits so sea is the best way so in this system um the best way to make money is actually piracy so as you can see there are lots of islands scattered around Greece and so the Greeks in the beginning were mainly pirates okay so the people who invaded uh Troy during the during the Trojan war were pirates okay the Mians were being famous for being pirates okay so as you can this this is a much um clearer map uh Masonian civilization they had pottery they had olive oil they had certain grade goods for trade uh but mainly it was really about uh transportation logistics piracy and controlling trade routes okay that's why Msania was so important at this time uh this is Troy by the way okay as you can see uh during the Trojan War what will happen is you have different people of Mia go attack Troy because it's such a strategic location right they able to control Troy they control the entire ANC okay okay so this is an artist tradition of what um the um Minian civilization looked like it is what we call a palace economy meaning all the center of the economy was a palace what would happen is that all the farmers had to give the palace their food and the palace would then take this food and redistribute it to the um um artisans okay people who made pottery people who made um clothing for for and textiles for trade purposes okay so it was a control and control and command economy center of the palace okay this is what the palace looks like this is how what the economy looks like okay so all the food would go to the palace and the palace would redistribute the food and the food palace would then take the food to give to the artisans to make textiles for trade okay and this is what the economy it was a very simple economy but was very effective it was extremely wealthy place this is a gold mass okay gold is very rare as you know and they turn it into a king some have speculate this is the mass of Agamanon who is a major character in the Iliad we'll discuss Iliad next class we actually don't know who this is okay um this is a sword with gold with a gold hilt so it just shows you how extremely wealthy they are right even the warriors had gold um this is something called the lion's gate so the entrance into Masonia this is a very rough time lots of wars lots of piracy so there's lots of walls okay um the other thing about the Min civilization is their tombs are very very elaborate okay this is the entrance into one of their tombs over time we see the tombs get become more and more elaborate so we know that over time they they were became a much more wealthy civilization okay this is what the tombs look like they're huge places okay this is what what the outside looks like where where do the mian learn this well they learn this from Egypt right so at this time in history the Minanians and the Egyptians were in close contact with each other the Egyptians have a habit of uh burying themselves with all their treasure okay so this is their coffin this is a mustaba which is their tomb okay as you can see it's huge it's it's almost as big as a house so the question is why would they do that okay we we've discussed it previously where throughout most of human history we've understood that this is material realm and then once we die we go off to spiritual realm guess what guys you can't take your money with you so why are you burying your money with you right okay this is a mustaba okay as you can see it's a very elaborate ornate place and the Egyptians were known for this but also China right the first emperor of China the terracotta warriors why is he buried with an army and such wealth that makes no sense if you die you die so why is this happening um so the argument I I want to make to you is that this is happening because money capital too much of it changes the fundamental chemistry of the brain it makes you crazy okay so um let's let's let's do a thought experiment okay the thought experiment is this let's just say Satan were to come into this room and said "Hey I'll give you guys a billion dollars but and you but you have to live forever and you have to be my slave forever." We' be like "No why why would we want that?" You know like to have a billion dollars but then be a slave for all eternity to like say it no but okay let's assume we are the richest people on earth we all have a $10 billion right now then says to us "You know what $10 billion is a lot of money i'm sure you enjoy your life but you're going to die and when you die you can't take that money with you but hey I can make you live forever i will let you keep this money but you have to be my slave for all eternity." Do you agree we would agree that's the difference you see what you see what's happened right money makes people crazy all right so bronze okay so remember brine started off as just a weapon in order to obtain power but then over time as powerful people became more stable in their lives they use um bronze to make jewelry and and pottery to show their status okay and then over time because rich people wanted it everyone wanted it and so bronze became a currency wealth and it was just easy to store universally recognized and mobile and this happened over centuries over 100 years okay that's a that's a pattern here all right so um this is a map a table that shows you how capital is formed okay so capital needs to have universality the more people want it the more valuable it is it's it has to be able to be it has to store value okay it has to be permanent okay does that make sense um it has to be mobile it has to be available okay um it has to be rare enough so once that it has these different elements then it becomes a currency so if you just look at history um we've we've used different sources of currency so we have sea shells cattle grain woman slaves drugs oil bronze gold and US dollar we've always had money as a concept okay but um money for most of human history signified a debt that could not be paid off okay so David Grabber who's an anthropologist he wrote he wrote about this in his book debt why do we create money as a concept because there are certain transactions in which there was so much debt you couldn't pay it off okay so mo so like most of um human actions it's just reciprocal right so you help me I help you okay but there are three things in which the debt can't can't be really paid off okay the first the first example is let's let's just say I kill your brother well now you come kill me right and you kill me then my family's going to go go kill you okay and it creates a vicious cycle of vengeance right so the way to get rid of this problem is if I kill your brother I acknowledge that it's a debt I cannot be paid off so I give you something valuable it could be gold it could be um jewelry it could be anything okay all right right so that's what money is that that's the first example second example is if if a woman marries into your family right then that's also a debt that that can be paid off because you've just taken away my a daughter so you give me a gift maybe some gold maybe a cow a horse it doesn't matter okay the second example of a debt that can be paid off the third example and this this is a really important example is let's just say that you have a great person in community he's a great leader or he's a great priest or he's just a great person in general and he's done a lot for you and but he dies what do you do then what you do is you bury him with gifts with gold with money okay and so it's a monument to his legacy you know that he can't take the stuff with him to the afterorld but it doesn't matter all you're doing is you're acknowledging his contribution to your community and that's why when we dig up graves in ancient times you'll see people bearded with gold because the human is acknowledging this person was great we will forever remember him and so the money is a way to acknowledge this fact okay does that make sense right so for most of human history that's what we use money for as to symbolize money that can be not be that cannot be paid off but then over time as society became more sophisticated u we use we use other forms of currency okay and as you can see all these different forms of currency okay whether it's seashells cattle grain women's drugs oil it doesn't really work in terms of universality store value immobility but bronze does okay and after bronze gold does and then after gold today we have the US dollar okay does that make sense okay so once you have an universally accepted currency you can now have globalization right and so bronze was a major discovery which allowed for globalization um yeah go ahead uh I think bronze and the gold is commodities and US dollar is like money stuff but why does browns because it is it because drugs and oil does not count as capital so it is not okay look let's you're right okay drugs can be a currency the problem is that it's not universally accepted okay and also the problem with drugs of course is it it causes a lot of problems your society so think of opium in China and it's it's hard um yeah it creates a lot of problems so it can't be universally accepted in fact most countries would ban drugs but at the same time you're right in that it is valuable it's a store of value so you guys don't know this but there are lot lots of governments that have secret supplies of drugs because if the world falls apart and you need to rebuild society you need wealth right so gold you need gold but guess what drugs is also a form of wealth because people want it okay people crave it all right um so so is this clear right so once you have a universally accepted currency you have the basis for globalization and global globalization happens naturally as a result all right so capital is just the monetization of power that's all it is and you can have any form of capital okay the problem with capital is that it exploits it alienates and it consolidates okay so go back go back example where I'm the leader of a village if there's no money involved all I care about is winning the respect of my people okay and so I work hard for them but once capital is involved I see each person as a commodity okay and therefore I become alienated from my humanity and from others and now I want to exploit people in order to generate more capital and over time what will happen is that um the strongest will have all the capital which leads to massive inequality so the only result of capitalism is one massive inequality corruption immorality okay and alienation anger indifference and this is the world we live in today does that make sense it's just the nature of capital there's no way around it okay so as we discussed previously we have two different mindsets okay we're composed of two different individuals we have the altruistic nature so we care about relationships we care about empathy we care about creativity and there's our utitarian side which is all about material objectives logic and hard work okay so in school you have the utarian mindset okay like how do I get good grades that's all you care about all right at home you care about relationships you care about maintaining good relationships with your mother and your father and your siblings and your relatives what we also know and this is really important is that people who are altruistic people who work for others tend to be more creative than other people but people who are obsessed with money tend to work harder than other people okay that's why polarization happens so fast because everyone's in a rush to make as much money as possible okay but eventually you reach a point where a few people have all the money and so everyone's like "Screw this i give up because I'm I'm never going to be rich you lie flat right tping or quite quitting you just give up okay and this is the world we live in today okay now capitalism is a problem because it changes the fundamental nature of your brain okay so this is a article from the Atletic Monthly which is a very popular magazine in the United States um there are these neuroscientists who have done brain scandals brain scans and they discovered that power causes brain damage okay in fact if you look at the brain of a psychopath and the brain of a wealthy person it's pretty similar okay yeah they did brand brain scans and it looks as though people with who have too much money has brain damage why because a normal person is able to have empathy is able to understand the feelings of others guess what if you're too powerful if you're too wealthy you don't have the capacity to have empathy you don't you can't appreciate the feelings of others so think of like Ellen Musk or Marcus Zuckerberg they I don't care they have actually no concept of empathy okay they are completely unable to relate to the feelings of other people this is Brian Johnson okay um Brian Johnson's a millionaire he spends about $2 million a year on health okay um he's done some crazy things so for example he has a father and he has a son and he believes in blood transfusion so you know if you you know transfuse the blood your blood you become younger so he's trying to figure out how to live forever okay so he'll do things like blood transfusion but you know he has he works so hard man cuz he'll get up at like 5:00 in the morning exercise the food he eats is the most nutritious food in the world and he'll regulate his sleep he's always monitoring his heartbeat he's always exercising okay his life sucks and the question you have have to ask yourself is if you have so much money why don't you just enjoy it you know why not why not just enjoy your life why are you focused on living forever okay and that's a problem with wealthy people they're kind of scooping their head okay um he looks like a vampire guys okay this is him when he first you know started this project and you can see he looks like a vampire now all right i'm not exaggerating here look look at this guy the problem is that there are lots of wealthy people in the world and they happen to like this idea of living forever okay so let's just say let's do a thought experiment you're a billionaire okay you have the you have you have like $100 million $10 million sorry like $10 billion in the bank $100 billion in the bank who knows you have a problem which is how do I keep this right because you're going to die okay and you have all that money so you can do whatever you want so what you do is you invest in Brian Johnson you invest in psychic research to live longer but you also do what you also build bunkers okay because you're afraid that the world will end and you want to live forever so you build bunkers this is Mark Zuckerberg's bunker in Hawaii it's kind of stupid because if the world's if the world's going to end is your bunker going to save you probably not okay but he spent like $26 million no or $260 million on this stupid thing hoping to live forever and this is what it looks like in on the on the inside it's crazy to like go through life thinking about how to live forever and how to survive an apocalypse why not just enjoy your life okay they also join secret societies why because secret societies may have the secret to in reincarnation or the secret to immortality or the secret to longevity they don't care they have so much money that they're willing to invest in everything okay so they're willing to um try blood transfusion they're willing to build bunkers they're also willing to join secret societies and that's why you see secret societies growing in power and popularity today they also worship Satan okay because again if you have $10 billion you're stuck right because you don't want to die like you don't want like it's what we call sunk cost fallacy right you you you you you're like I worked so hard for this and I have the best life but I'm going to die and when I die all this is gone i have to start all over again i don't want to do that okay so they're willing to do anything including worship Satan in fact what we will learn is that the the religion of Satan became so popular in order to solve this problem where wealthy people they want to live forever and they want the world to stay the same as it is now but as you learn in this class it is impossible for the world to stay the way it is change is a constant things move in cycles capitalism gives rise to wealth but it also destroys wealth that's just the nature of life okay all right so that's a branch age collapse any questions sorry yeah go ahead V go ahead why do they worship Satan because you said that those millionaires they want to keep their money forever and what does it do with Satan okay that's a really good question okay so um it's really desperation right because what religion tell teaches teaches you is that wealth is bad and when you go to heaven you'll be judged by God and God and God is going to ask you "Hey why do you have so much money man?" And you'll be like "Well I stole this money and I hurt a lot of people and I cheated i lied i stealed." Yeah you know and like do you really want to say that to God yeah you're kind of stuck right right so so first of all you don't want to die you don't want to give up all this money that you worked hard to get but you also don't want to face God and face his judgment okay so what's your alternative here your alternative is you believe in something more powerful than God or at least someone who you can find refuge in from God okay if it means going to hell you you prefer going to hell than facing judgment from God okay cuz you in your heart know exactly what you did to get that $10 billion okay you know what you did maybe other people don't know but you know what you did and God knows what you did and you really really want to face judgment all right okay so yeah does that make sense okay any more questions guys all right so um that's it for the branches so we will discuss the iliad next class okay and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce the um Iliad today and then and then we'll continue the Iliad on Thursday okay all right so the branches collapse is important because it will give rise to Greek civilization which we we which we believe to be the basis for western civilization okay so the question then is how does this happen okay so if you look at mine in Greece and then we transition into um the dark ages okay the dark ages does not all it means is that the Greeks lost the capacity to write okay and so what will happen is M say in Greece will transform from a past economy into something called the polus okay polis city state okay that this is where where we get the word politics from okay so this is a major political transition where you went from a centralized economy to now city states competing against each other that's the first thing second thing that's important is the writing system changes it went from linear B linear B become now becomes do you guys know what what's a new writing system called i'm sure you guys know the name alphabet okay all right and the big the third big change is you go from censorship okay because remember in a palace economy in a centralized system bureaucrats are in control and bureaucrats control what is talked about okay or what is expressed and they censor and centralize content okay they they basically create propaganda so now with censorship you have a new person emerged named Homer okay and we will discuss Homer next class and these things these three things together become the basis for Greek civilization and this is why the Greeks became the greatest civilization ever in human history so the main lesson I want to leave you today is yes collapse is bad but collapse also gives opportunity for a new civilization to arise for a new humanity to emerge and we will discuss this next class okay the birth of Greekization all right great all right
