good morning class today we do the theory of everything so very quickly I will explain to you what science tells us about where we came from who we are and where we're going so as you may know it all started with a big bang okay the big bang so in the beginning there was a massive ball of energy and then it exploded okay and because of this explosion it would create stars and planets and black holes and solar systems and that's how the universe was created through the big bang then we had the earth and on earth life evolved starting with um plants and sea life and then we had um lizards mammals and then we got to humans okay so evolution the thing about evolution that's very important to understand is that it's all about m mutation so the genes will randomly mutate and then those genes that are best adapted to the environment will survive okay and this is idea of the survival of the fittest introduced to us by Charles Darwin okay and that's how we came to dominate the planet because we are the fittest because we're able to work together because we had language which allows us to store knowledge and pass it on to future gener generations to accumulate new technology okay so that's the theory of evolution now we get to the human mind right the human mind is unique in the universe um it allows us to communicate with each other it allows us to imagine things it allows us to be creative and so neuroscience teaches us that our brains what we our brains do is we filter experiences into memories now if you take psychology you will know that there's long-term memory and short-term memory short-term memory is just what you have today long-term memory is what stays in you okay so what the brain does is that it differentiates between shortterm and long-term and then this long term is stored into a database of memories and it's divided according to your emotions okay happy sad angry scared okay so there's a rainbow of emotions and all your memories are stored according to the different emotions inside your brain the database of your brain and from this you are able to create an identity identity is basically an understanding of who you are your place in the world and how you should best navigate the world okay so the idea of identity now what you also learn in psychology is it is possible for you to create many different identities so in a school you're a student at home you're a child at work you're an employee okay and all these identities put together is called a world view and you can understand this as your personality okay all right so this is all that science knows i mean this is pretty simple but this is what science tells us about where we came from who we are where we're going now there are three distinct characteristics about the Islam okay the first is that this is all random okay okay this is really important because before we understood this as design okay before we believe that there was a god now we believe there's no god all this is just random that's the first thing I need you guys to remember second thing I need you guys to remember is that it's all material material before we understood the universe as spirit mainly spirit but now we understood it as mainly material things that we can see and touch we cannot see it we cannot touch it we cannot measure it it does not exist the third characteristic is that it is emergent emergent which is basically means bottom up you have like these particles they become atoms then the atoms become matter they become stuff and then we become chairs or people okay it's all emergent and so these are the three major principles of our world view today and you should have learned most of this in science class now there's a problem with all these theories all right right so I'm going to go over them one by one and I want I want to make sure you follow along okay because what I will do now is I will show you the problems the deficiencies the flaws in all these theories okay so let's start with the big bang now if it is true that the universe started off with a big bang and it just expands slowly then it should it should expand linearly okay but what we see is this first of all the universe it expands weirdly okay it's more like this so as it expands different parts move faster than other parts that makes no sense also certain galaxies okay galaxies move faster than other galaxies this makes no sense either so the way that astronomers have explained away these statical problems is to introduce a new concept called dark energy and dark energy is most of the universe it's it's like at least 80% some scientists believe it is 90% so most of the universe is composed of dark energy and of course you're like what is dark energy and the answer is we don't know now dark energy sounds like we don't see it that's how it is it's we don't know what it is and quite honestly it's cheating okay so let me give an example let's just say you take a math test and the teacher asks you 19887 plus 25 and your answer is 20 okay that's obviously wrong right so your teacher says this is wrong and then you say "Oh I know how to fix this." Plus dark energy problem solved okay this is like literally what cosmologists are doing with dark energy we don't know what it is but they say it must be there because otherwise we cannot explain these statistical inconsistencies in our measurements and modeling and then of course you're like well why don't you just say that the Big Bang theory is wrong and they're like well we could say that the problem is we don't have a better model well in fact there is a better model the better model is there are different big banks okay so if you just assume that there are different big banks well this helps us understand what's going on better but then the question then is wait a minute there are multiple big bangs why are there multiple big bangs okay so our current system of understanding the universe simply does not work and the problem is that it's become a paradigm a story that is accepted by most scientists and they refuse to budge on this issue okay but I'm telling you right now that this system is clearly problematic and it could be wrong okay so that's a problem with um the big bang now let's move on to evolution okay evolution now in theory evolution does work and it works for most animals except when it comes to human beings okay because that the the idea of evolution is gradual progress but we don't know how we went from the ape okay to the human we share with the ape other monkeys 99.9% of DNA but we don't know why we're so different from the ape okay that's the first problem second problem is humans have been around for for about 200,000 years okay that's a long long time we only have maybe 50,000 years of history so where do the other 100,000 150,000 years go we don't know okay so this is also another huge problem with the theory of evolution the third problem is according to evolution there should be many different types of human beings but in fact there's only one homo sapiens now what scientists will tell you is well before there were different species the n theanthodol the cromagnet and then gradually homo sapiens took them over and that's and you can believe that but it's problematic because according to evolution there should be many many different types of humans okay maybe some with six fingers some with three eyes like animals Okay so the lack of diversity in the human species it's a it's it doesn't really fit into the evolution model okay all right so that's problem with evolution the real problem is with the human mind okay so let's go over some of the problems all right so with neuroscience what they teach you is that what the world view does that's very important is that it filters memories okay the reason why is every day you're absorbing a lot of experiences your if your brain were to absorb all the experiences your brain will explode because there's too much information to process therefore your world view pro processes different experiences it differentiates between experiences that are important and experiences that are not important and experiences that are important of course goes into your long-term memory the problem with this is how about babies in theory babies should not have a worldview they should not have a personality but if that's the case then how do they process memories how do they know what memories to store what memories not to store okay the other thing is that I have three kids and I can tell you that they're all distinct personalities it seems as though they were born with a world view and then the question then is where does this come from your eye color your hair your height comes from your parents DNA right so does your is your personality from your parents DNA probably not okay just ask yourself am I a composition of my parents' personalities you're not you're a different person than your parents so this is a huge problem with this model where does the personality come from and why is it embedded in us from the very first day okay what's more problematic is how we think consciousness we do not have currently a model for how we think in fact if you study neuroscience you will find there are a lot of gaping holes in our understanding of the brain for example we do not know where the brain stores memory that's very unusual because a memory is a building block of everything but we don't know in the brain where it is stored yeah isn't that hypocus excuse me isn't that hypocus no the hippoc campus no no it's not we we we don't know where where it's stored there are certain things this that we know where it's stored for example we know where maybe language is stored we know where faces are stored okay so maybe the phases are stored in the hippoc campus but we don't know where memory is stored okay so what we say is the entire brain stores memories but that's another saying we don't know where it's stored all right so the other thing is that our current model of the brain it's like a city okay think of the brain as a city and what makes the brain work are the roads or what we call the synapses when they hit each other it has it creates electricity and that's where we think that um how thought is generated okay but this is problematic because um we think a lot okay so let me give you an example of this to clarify now in science class you're taught the scientific method okay what's the scientific method well you do research you create a hypothesis from the research and then you create an experiment to test out the hypothesis and then you have data and then you make observations and then you refine the hypothesis okay and this is what we believe a way to model the act of thinking and you're taught this in every class even in in English class right you do research then you create an outline right the outline has a thesis with three evidence right and then you write it out write a draft you edit it and you repeat the process okay this this is what you're taught in school okay i'm going to say something that shocks that that will shock you okay this is what you you're taught in school this is what you believe works but as someone who is much older than you are as someone who actually thinks for a living who teaches for a living who writes for a living I'm going to tell you how you actually think is a complete opposite okay so what happens is you actually you actually think or imagine the story or the idea to begin with okay and then you start working backwards to create the process you're taught in school it's a process that creates the the idea what I'm telling you is that in reality it's the idea that creates the process okay so let me give you an example of this if you look at every major scient discovery it all came to the person in a dream or when he was or it sort of popped into that person's head okay it's just think of a light bulb light bulb popping up okay so an example is Albert Einstein albert Einstein created his theory relatively not in a laboratory not by um doing research with other scientists but simply by sitting in a patent office every day and just daydreaming and then boom the idea came to his head he's like "Okay now I have this idea now what he's going to do is go back and look for the evidence to support his idea." Yes hypothesis okay um is a hypothesis the idea okay no the hypothesis is the assumption okay what okay what what I'm trying to tell tell you is this what I'm trying to tell you is the idea or the final product comes first then you go backwards okay and you create the draft then you create the outline then you do the research okay now I know this sounds weird but let me give you more examples james Watson came up with the double helix model of DNA how he did this was he spent years and years working to figure out how DNA worked and then boom one day he had a dream of a staircase a double staircase and he's like maybe that's the model I need to use and then he start to do more research and he discovered hey this works okay but the question then is how did that get into his head okay let me give you another example um I write books and I've written three novels um and you won't believe this okay but but my wife is here and and like she knows how I work you would think that when you write a book you would spend every day at the at the desk and um read books take notes and then transform it into a book right i don't do that what I do is I lie in bed and I might play some video games or I might read a book okay i get up I walk to the park and I come back and I have all these ideas and I write down all these ideas over one hour two hours on the computer okay then I'm exhausted i've run out of ideas and I'm like "Okay tomorrow what am I going to do if I have no ideas i can't write anymore." But what happens is the next day I get up and I have new ideas and I write it back and I I write it down again okay so it's not like I am generating these ideas it's more like I'm receiving these ideas if you watch me actually watch me work it is almost impossible to think that I actually do any work because I'm always like lying around or walking around or daydreaming okay my wife tells me that when I write or when I work it's like I'm possessed i'm possessed by something okay meaning like I actually I don't see anything and I really don't know what other people are doing because I don't care i don't care because I'm focused on my work okay also I'll give you another example the way I teach now when you see me teach you think oh you must have a script you must have outlined the class i don't do that i have a conception i have a framework in my head i come to class and I teach how do I teach i watch your observations i watch your facial expressions and based on your responses I then start to flesh out the framework and how how and and how do I do that because I'm always accessing a higher force and I'm receiving this information that I can then articulate to you in class and that's why if you have been with me for a long long time 10 years you will know I've never taught the same class ever you can go on YouTube and watch all my videos i teach this class different each time because each time what I'm doing is I'm channeling a higher force and bring it to you but it is a conversation it's a dialogue it's no different from reading a book or seeing a great painting okay each experience is unique because when you because a painting or the book it's almost like a platform for you to experience the divine or higher power okay when you read a great book that's literally what you feel you feel as though you are in conversation with the universe and this book is really a portal into the universe okay if you read a good great book I'm not sure if if you had if you had uh read a good great book okay so if you want to really be creative you have to trust the universe if you really really want to destroy your creativity you follow this system okay so what I'm telling you and that's I know this this is going to be weird but school it destroys your creativity because it teaches you a process that does not work no scientist in the history of humanity has ever come up with a great idea using the psyic method i guarantee you they've all came up with a great idea through their imagination through their intuition by channeling the divine okay that's every single scientist including um Einstein Newton uh yes I wait sorry can you speak to Okay so I agree with what you're saying but I personally I I I think scientific method is more like how people how these inspirational ideas are being presented to others oh yes good point exactly that's that's exactly correct okay so I use static method in order to convince other people that I'm correct you're absolutely correct because if I told people oh I had a dream well like is that convincing okay so the sc method is a way for for us to communicate and spread ideas you're absolutely correct okay but as I say you will never ever have a great discovery by following a seic method you have to have an inspiration and then use the same method to explain your inspiration to other people okay yeah and another thing sorry and another thing is that I I think how people absorb ideas or look like how how how you wrote a book is by based on your at least some some of the points are based on your experience because let's just say a person has born and he never like he has no knowledge and he has no experiencing on uh anything and I don't see the possibility for him to just observe this energy energy out of nothing okay you're exactly correct yes and I'll explain this as we move on okay all right but I want to show you there's lots of issues with um how the SIC method is taught in school okay so but but but are you guys clear all right but but but that's a good point let me continue all right so let me continue we have so much evidence that we communicate with a higher power all the time all right so so let's go over some of the evidence okay the first piece of evidence is nearde experiences ndees near-deaf experiences are um when you almost die okay or you're dead for like 10 seconds or 10 minutes who knows but there are thousands tens of thousands of these testimonies on YouTube and they all say the same thing when they die they see a tunnel and at the tunnel there's a light that draws them okay they go and then suddenly they are high up and they feel tremendous love peace forgiveness compassion it's all good and then they submit to a life review they have a chance to reflect on their entire life they can see all the pain they caused they can see all the good they've done in the world and then they're asked by a higher force and it's like God or an angel but like there are different interpretations okay do you want to go back and they always say yes I need to go back why because I need to tell people about my experience and they come back extremely changed people and again these are people who don't know each other and maybe before they were atheists or just scientists but once they have these experiences it changes them forever okay so near-death experiences we have prompts explaining why this is the case second is the is the idea of psychedelics okay okay psychedelics so throughout human history every culture has had has used psychedelics because psychedelics were a way for shamans or priests to access the divine and what's really interesting is when you use a certain type of psychedelic you end up seeing the same images regardless of who you are okay and that's why civilizations throughout human history what's amazing is if you go back to the ancient past and you look at different civilizations in different parts of the world they have very similar statues and paintings okay so what's a very common motif is that you have a cosmic serpent for whatever reason every early civilization has worship a serpent or serpent the serpent is a very important part of their culture and it's possible that when they're psychedelics and they're meditating they see a serpent talking to them and they see that as the serpent of life okay and also what's really interesting is the serpent it's almost it looks like the DNA right okay so that's really really interesting okay um meditation when people meditate when you go up to a higher uh dimension you you end up you end up having the same experience of psychedelics and they do have experiences also great books I myself have never done psychedelics I obviously can't go back in the past and study these civilizations I never had a near near-death experiences but I've read Dante I've read Milton i've read Homer i've studied them very very closely and it what's amazing to me is they say the same things when Dante in his Divine Comedy when he describes the universe when he describes God when he describes the heavens it's almost as though he's describing a near-death experience even though we have absolutely no evidence that Donn himself had a near-death experiences okay so this is shocking okay so there's a lot of evidence that there's a higher force beyond us so the spirit world does exist again I can't prove it exists but a lot there's a lot of evidence to suggest it does exist okay so now the question then is if our current model of reality doesn't really work what is another possibility okay and in this class I'm not trying to tell you what is true but I'm just trying to present to you new possibilities so what I'm going to do now is I will present to you a new possibility of how of how reality is structured okay all right so to begin let's talk about Kant emanuel Kant was the greatest philosopher who ever lived the most influential philosopher who ever lived because he introduced us the idea that we are not observers of reality we are participants in reality all right so let me explain what he means for Kant there's a nana the nana just means reality that is outside of us the things in themselves what he tells us is we can never know no the nana we can never know this reality why because whenever we see reality we filter it using time and space okay so time and space do not exist outside of us they are part of us we use time and space in order to interpret reality in a way that allows us to make sense of it okay so the nina for time and space becomes the phenomena and that's all we see the phenomena the things that are to me not the nana the things in themselves okay and so we imagine reality we hallucinate reality okay but of course this creates three problems okay the first problem is uh what is the nomena the second problem is why do we have these filters time and space the third problem is how do how can we guarantee that what I see is the same as what you see because if reality is a subjective experience then in theory everyone should see it differently but we all see it the same okay so why is that so these are the three problems and so what happens is that Hegel comes along okay hegel another German philosopher he explains the idea of the gist so what he's saying is that the nana it's really the spirit world it's the gist and when you do this it solves all three problems okay the nana you can never access because it's beyond us it's a gist that gives us time and space and as a result because it's all coming from one source we see the world in the same way okay all right so this sounds complicated but but but let me now use quantum mechanics to explain what this means okay let's let's talk about quantum mechanics okay so in science class you're taught the neo bore model of the atom okay it's a simple model you have the nucleus and then around the nucleus you have these electrons that orbit the nucleus okay you taught this in physics class um if you are in more advanced physics you were taught that it's actually an electron cloud why because we never know for sure what electrons are so we can only know the probability of where they are in orbit okay so it's called electron cloud and this is what you're taught in school when you go to university you're you will be taught this is completely and utterly wrong why because this assumes that these atoms are matter they're solid but in reality if you go deep enough you will find that they are actually just vibrations what we call quantum fields and they are just vibrations and what the electron really is is an intersection of these quantum fields also these quantum fields can always exist in two states the first is as a wave the second is as a particle okay and we can only know if it's a wave or a particle by observing it and this is what what's called a wave function collapse in other words all of nature is vibrational it's energy and it's only when we observe it when you interact with it that becomes something solid that we can see and measure and touch okay it's called a wave function collapse okay so this is complicated so a a um physicist named Erns Schroinger he creates a thought experiment called Schroinger's cat okay you may have heard of it schroinger's cat and so imagine a box and inside is a cat and then the cat in inside the box is also some toxic chemicals that may or may not break if it breaks the cat dies if it doesn't break the cat the cat's still alive and what Shinju teaches us is that when the box is unopened we can never know the state of the cat it's only when we open it can we know it's dead or alive but before then it's both dead and alive okay that's simple you understand but then another physicist introduced a new concept called the friend experiment or Wner's friend and this is more complicated because he says "Okay if you are the experimentter and you open the box you now know the state of the cat but what if you're a friend okay you're you don't see the box you're outside the laboratory when the experiment opens the box does the wave function collapse?" And the answer is it does not okay it does not and what this is telling us is there is no objective reality that exists outside of you when the experimenttor opens the box the wave function collapses for him but does that collapse for the observer and for anyone else we have to open the box ourselves in order to see if the cat is alive or dead okay but what if this person tells us the answer is it still doesn't collapse we have to participate in the reality ourselves and what this is saying okay this is hard to understand is that everyone lives in his or her own reality everyone has a unique universe onto himself or herself and that's what quantum mechanics teaches us okay all right so now let's try to based on all this okay quant and quantum mechanics create a theory of reality okay so what's important to understand is that all everything are just vibrations okay that's all it is it's vibrations yeah but I thought like quantum mechanics can only be applied on quantum whereas we are a macro creature that is not like yeah that is correct but the quantum mechanics is the is the basis of reality right okay so we are so everything are just vibrations now what happens is that what we need to understand is that if it's vibrations if it's energy it's also information okay does that make sense all right so what our brains do is our brains are not independent our brains connect to the universe okay so as the universe is vibrating we're receiving information and then through our experiences okay this vibration allows us to turn it into memories you understand we're taking this um vibrational information we're taking our experiences we're combining to memories now this is really important the memories now go back to the vibrational force so our memories are connecting to the universe and they're being stored in the universe they're being imprinted in the universe it's an imprint and this and of of course this is no different from the internet right on the computer whatever you write is being stored on the internet so whatever you do is going to change the internet and you receive information from the internet okay so you're participating in the internet and you're part of the internet okay and the same thing is happening here okay so everything's vibrational if it's vibrational it's information we we turn we take the information and we combine with the experiences turn into memories the memories then go back to the universe and so it's as as it's it's as though we can implant ourselves into the universe okay now this is hard to understand so what we've done is every single culture has turned this knowledge into a story that is easy for people to understand okay so I'm going to tell you the story and this story this framework I'm actually using Dante okay all right dante what what does Dante tell us about the universe okay just the Monad the one God who knows okay but it's the source of everything and so what he does is he vibrates he emanates he thinks he breathes and this creates vibrational force right and this vibrational force creates new forces called diads diads are peers and when the peers come together and vibrate they create new things okay so this is how creation happens through vibration through the combination of different um forces okay now what's important to understand is that as the dimensions go lower the frequency decreases so at high it's really fast right it's like ah okay when it goes low it becomes low frequency oh okay and eventually you get a point where matter can be created okay so this is spirit this is matter and this is the world that we live in okay so now the question then is why is a universe set up in this way and it has to do with the fact that the universe the monad strives for newness for imagination for freshness the problem though is that in the spirit world everything is perfect everything is eternal everything is immutable and so by definition you can feel no pain you cannot suffer you cannot make any mistakes therefore you can you cannot have any new experiences therefore you cannot you cannot have have any imagination so we humans exist in order to solve this problem we humans are corporal which is which all it just means is we have bodies okay if you have bodies you go you get old you bleed you get hurt you fall down okay you feel um anger you feel hate but this allows us to have an imagination and the imagination allows the universe to grow to expand to vibrate okay that's our function to have experiences that are new which expands the consciousness of the universe universe itself is consciousness all right so for this system to work there have to be some guiding principles to this universe the first and most important principle is the principle of free will without free will this system cannot work if if you are if if you do what you're supposed to do you can't have imagination okay so you have to disobey you have to make your own choices you have to make your own mistakes and this is what allows the universe to imagine okay but the problem then is if you have free will how do you know you're doing good how do you know you're doing evil and the answer is the idea of love okay so the monad is the totality of love we are a part of the monad okay we're part of the monad and so there's a spark of the monad in us called love and so when we do good we feel good because the love the spark is growing in us and it's almost like a magnet okay we want to return to the monad and so we do good because it makes us feel good and allows us to return to the monad but sometimes because we live in a world of free will we make mistakes okay we might hurt someone or we might be or we might traumatize someone in which case we feel anger and then this becomes a vicious cycle okay so now there's another system set up to ensure we don't get trapped by our hate and this system is called death okay in this system death is released it prevents us from forever making mistakes because you could have a terrible life right but it's okay because then you go die you go back you go back into the universe and now you can observe everything that you did okay you can see all the pain you've caused you can see all the good that you've done and so you become wiser and you come back and you live another life and again you can make the same mistakes over and over but you can also improve okay now the other thing to remember about the system is that it's our choice whether you create love or hate now love goes back to the monad but what happens when you create hate well you need to store it somewhere so it goes into lower dimensions okay hate all right so we create new dimensions through hate through anger through fear through bad emotions that cannot return the spirit world because the spirit world is perfect and so this is called hell and this called heaven okay and this is how the universe is set up okay so I'm just taking the literal reality and turning to the metaphorical reality which becomes the basis of all early religions okay so there are different metaphors that we can use to understand uh this system but let's look at let's look at look at um one from Hinduism and one from Dante okay so in Hinduism there's a metaphor that's very powerful and the metaphor is that in the house of the god Indra Indra is one of the most powerful gods of India there's all these pearls that float okay and what do what do pearls do they reflect other pearls and what happens is this because there's a spark in us if one of our sparks grows bright all the other pearls grow bright as well okay so literally because God is inside of you because there's a spark inside of you because you're capable of love when you do love you're capable of changing the entire universe because your love expands outward and your love reflects in other people as well okay so Dante uses the idea of mirrors there's a candle there's a flame and we're all mirrors that reflect the candle okay god God is a candle we're just the mirrors but every one of us no matter how far we are from God we um the his flame burns in us okay so you could be far away and you could feel as though God has forgotten you but there's still the flame inside you okay so for Dante and for our early civilizations God is love forever okay eternal love but God is also eternal compassion eternal forgiveness god will never forgive you sorry God will never forget you okay he will always forgive you but you have to believe in God to return to God you have to live a life of righteousness of love of compassion of imagination if you want to return to God okay so that's how the universe is set up we are here our divine mission is to expand the consciousness of the universe and we do that by embracing love and by imagining the world to be a better place okay all right so now let's go back and ask ourselves this question if every single early religion whether it's Dowoism or Hinduism or the Egyptians or the Native Americans if every early religion all believed this and they all knew this how did we come to forget or deny this with a material reality okay remember the big bang evolution neuroscience it's to teach us that there's no God there's no purpose it's all just random it's all just material so how do we get this to this point okay the answer is very simple and we'll be discussing this throughout CLA throughout the rest of the semester okay the problem is that you have heaven you have earth and you have hell okay the heaven is spiritual it's consciousness hell it's mechanical it's machines okay we're stuck in between it's always our choice whether to choose heaven or hell because of free will okay and for most of human history we have chosen um heaven but eventually you had people who chose hell and when you have choose hell you have access to technology right and this technology allows you to conquer and control other people okay but once you control and you conquer and control other people you have to get them to obey you if you are enlightened if you know the truth you know that none of this matters we're all we're all going to go we're all going to die so why should I listen to you so in order for me to control you I need you to fear death okay I need you to forget God and I need you to fear death when you die dying is the worst thing that can happen to you and because remember before people understood death was just a part of the journey it was a release it was an opportunity to reset yourself and come back now death is the worst thing that could ever happen to you okay so how do you forget God and how do you uh get people to fear death you use science right and you create theories like the big bang like evolution like neuroscience to forget to make people forget the divinity inside you right so that's what science is for but unfortunately for these people that's not enough because eventually we'll all die right so the only way around this is by creating a new technology called transhumanism okay you may have heard of transhumanism again don't worry about the concept now we'll we'll discuss this later on semester but transhumanism is to surpass humanity which basically means defeat death to upload you your brain to the internet so you're here forever okay to trap you here forever and so now the question then is um why are they doing this why are people in power doing this okay so um as we've discussed in this class throughout human history it's usually secret societies that have the power okay why okay well we last class we discussed the idea of bureaucracy right mass bureaucracy and we discussed how in a mass bureaucracy bureaucrats don't really want to do anything they're lazy well guess what if you're part of secret society and you're able to coordinate secretly together you can control the bureaucracy because you only need people doing stuff okay but then the question but the problem is bureaucracies do not like secrets secret societies so you have to maintain your secrecy and and how do you do that you do that through transgression if you guys are doing bad things together okay now you have blackmail on each other and therefore you're committed to keeping each other's secrets if one of you falls down everyone falls down together okay so now you're committed to um maintain a secrets but the problem is this the problem is okay it's conspiracy but the moment you're found out they'll come and arrest you so how do you work together without actually meeting each other and the answer is religion okay or the word we use is esquetology religion is just a script and understanding the world that allows you to coordinate secretly okay does all this make sense okay so now these secret societies they are embedded in mass bureaucracy and they're manipulating the bureaucracy and they're working together uh to commit transgression they have their own secret religion okay when you combine these three together what happens is that they're now forced to invert this understanding inversion why because they know that they're doing evil in this world so when they go meet God God's going to punish them right so the way to get around this is well I will just c I will just worship someone who's superior to God who is Satan okay okay so what they're going to do is going to invert this okay by celebrating Satan they can now justify all their transgressions right as a way to empower Satan also there's a fundamental weakness in the system okay so let's go over the three main characteristics of the system the first is unity okay so this entire system is complete and unified second is symmetry symmetry or polarity and what this means is that if there's good there must be evil if there's ugliness there must be beauty why because you cannot have one without the other okay one thing is meaningless without the other that's why you have God you must have Satan okay and the third principle is as above so below and what this means is that everything is a reflection of each other so you can never defeat God but what you can do is corrupt human beings to worship Satan so that Satan becomes everything okay all right are you guys following along okay so what you're trying to do is you're trying to invert this world and how do you invert this world what you do is you know that hell is material and you know that heaven is spiritual right what you do is you brainwash people to worship the material world and abandon the spiritual world you make money power technology science the greatest things in the world okay you get rid of God you get a religion you get rid of compassion you get rid you get rid of love and that's how you control the world so in other words what is happening today is a war between heaven and hell the people in charge the secret societies they are interested they must make heaven in make hell into heaven and heaven into hell they must invert the world in order to maintain their power okay and that's what we will be focusing on for the rest of the semester this war between heaven and hell how it came about who are the major players and what will happen yeah so I'm a bit confused about the part where um so the secret society are manipulating their power beyond the rest of the people and so they are devoting themselves into the power of Satan right but my question is so the this God and Satan they don't interfere they don't interfere to our world and so these are all just decisions made by the secret society itself yep okay so if well in that case if s say S Satan now goes beyond or has the power that goes be beyond God then God wouldn't do anything to like rebut or something yeah okay great great okay so um first thing to remember is that because of the principle of free will God and Satan cannot interfere in this world okay secondly is we have to remember like there are different secret societies there are thousands of different secret societies okay the secret societies that are able to use all three principles to accumulate power on on are the most successful okay so that's why they're promoting Satan um then the third question then is um why doesn't God do doing anything about this okay and the answer is because if you think about it in only in time of complete darkness only when Satan rules can humans fully shine right does that make sense so God has trust in us god has faith in us god loves us completely god believes that someone will stand up and do the right thing and when that person does the right thing the universe will shine okay does that make sense right so only in the time of darkness can the light truly shine and remember when someone shines that light that light is reflected in everyone else so everyone's light shines as well okay so that's the idea here you can choose to shine if you want but only if the world becomes really evil and dark and sinful can you have this option okay yeah back back there like is is there a really a god or a Satan and uh like uh there's a god for all of it and uh a god for all of the bad things or it's just two two worlds which is one positive one negative okay that's that's a really good question okay so what all this is saying is this okay in reality literally everything is vibrations all right how these vibrations work right no one knows but it's all just vibrational but what we know is we are participants in the universe so if we all believe God exists guess what god exists if we all believe sin exists sin exists okay that's why this war it's not over resources it's over perception do you understand this is a war of perception if I can get everyone in the world to believe that God is dead and Satan is a true God I win okay and how do I do that well I can do that by shooting rockets up into space by putting man on the moon and on Mars okay why because now I destroyed the concept of heaven before we've understood that the moon the Mars were beyond us because they are heavenly they're spiritual but once I put man on the moon and on Mars and go beyond I've proven heaven doesn't exist i've destroyed God i can also fake an alien invasion and pretend these aliens are Satan okay okay all science you you don't know this but all science it's not about discovering reality it's about reinventing reality in a way that serves power that's what science really is yeah so is there people who like they they don't believe in Satan or God they choose to let others believe in them like uh they're making themselves into a God does it work like because if you believe God uh then God exists like like if if everyone believes in it so if someone make everyone believes in him or her uh does does it work to make him into a god or Satan some kind of okay that's that's a good question and the answer is no historically what's happened is that a charismatic leader has emerged to say that I am God's representative okay why because um we believe we're all equal right you're no different than I what makes you God well the answer is because I'm channeling God okay and historically so like like look look at the early the early empires the early kingdoms what what they can say is that I'm descended from God god came down had sex with my mother and now I'm born okay but that person is not saying you know I am God itself but I am born of God okay does that make sense okay all right so this is the basic framework for what what we we'll be working with the rest of the semester okay but understand that what's happening today is a war between heaven and hell if I can convince you that God is dead and Satan is the true God if I if I can convince you that the material world is real the spiritual world is a lie if I can convince you that death is the worst thing to happen to you and you should do all you can to live then hell has won okay but what's important to understand is this system is set up so that hell can never win out and the reason why is the entire cosmos is interconnected so if we do evil if we feel pain if there's too much suffering in the world the earth itself rebelss right because of vibrational energy and this leads to things like the great flood which resets the world and lets humanity renew itself okay so there are all these different failsafe systems in there in here to make sure that um hell can never triumph and that's why Ellen Mus is wants us to go to Mars okay all right but understand you just use this concept of heaven and hell even though it's met metaphorical even though God and Satan are just projections of our imagination they do help us understand the world better okay okay so any questions any any more questions before we we conclude for today great okay so we'll continue this tomorrow uh uh um Friday yep okay
