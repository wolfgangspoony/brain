okay So today we are going to discuss civilization versus the steps Okay Civilization versus the steps The steps are the grasslands and you people often refer to them as barbarians Okay So in China we refer to these people as like barbarians And in school you're taught that there are major differences between civilization and barbarians Right so um the first major difference is that in civilization you are allowed intellectual freedom because only by reading books only by going to school only by learning how to think can you be free to think Okay Um and in a step we think of them as emotional slaves They are unpredictable They are violent Okay Second thing is that we think of civilization as open and curious We love knowledge We seek to gain more knowledge Therefore uh we are innovative Okay Whereas the steps people they are static Okay Because they are insular They're close-minded Okay And the last thing is that we think civilization leads to wealth and prosperity Only can you be only if you are civilized can you be truly be happy okay and wealthy And we think that the steps people are poor and therefore unhappy And that is the general understanding of the difference between civilization and the barbarians Okay The problem is that this creates a misunderstanding and we can't really explain why is it that throughout human history the steps people have been the greatest conquerors Okay Okay So the classic example is Genghask Khan How is it that Genghask Khan was able to not only conquer China okay which is one consider one of the greatest civilizations in the world but also um Baghdad another great civilization Okay But what's interesting is that throughout human history this has been a consist consistent pattern where the barbarians conquered the civilized people Okay so this is a problem How is it that how is it that if in civilization they're so free they're so smart they're so open they're so curious innovative and so prosperous why is it that they keep on losing out the steps people and the answer is because your traditional understanding is completely wrong Okay and I will show you that it's the complete actually the opposite It is the steps people who are open curious and innovative And it is the slicing people who are close-minded who are static and who are unhappy Okay So that's my argument to you today All right So let's go over um some of my uh points before I show you the PPT Okay All right So let's discuss how civilization starts So last class we understand that there's a major river and on top of this major river you have a city develop Okay remember that we come together for religious purposes We have settlements in order to celebrate nature celebrate God um celebrate our religion our belief system And over time what happens is that um this system becomes unequal it becomes hierarchical and therefore we leave But there are some places that are strategic for trade purposes and therefore people don't want to leave because you can generate a lot of wealth and prosperity in these places and so they become um major cities Okay So the first city in world civilization is Euro Eric Okay And over time they become more more prosperous They build canals Uh they learn farming They develop their own mythology Okay And then what happens is that as the population grows and grows they go off and colonize other places along the trade route Okay Maybe upstream and then downstream as well And then what happens is that the city these city states are now in competition with each other And they have a system of competition called open cooperative competition Okay this is a very important concept because this concept is what gives us innovation So if you have these three things in place open cooperation competition you'll be very innovative Open just means that you want to learn you want to grow you want to learn from others Cooperation means that you are in contact with others so you that you are learning the best practices from other people Competition means that you'll be better than they are Okay so in this system of city states you have massive innovation and we see this throughout human history Okay So think of China When was China the most innovative it was during the tun right the spring autumn period That's where we're getting confusious from Danza Okay All the great ideas came from this period of the chunu Okay this is also true for Mesopotamia This is also true for Egypt as well Okay and eventually what happens is that these citystates um all merge into an empire because during this process of innovation one city will be more innovative than the others and therefore they will conquer the others What's interesting often is that it is a city that is most disadvantaged that conquers the other cities because you're forced to be more innovative So in China the classic example is theQing right theqing was in the mountains They had lower population They were poorer They're more isolated And therefore that they have more innovative than the Jao the true the way uh dynasties Okay Okay And this is true also in throughout human history And so now you have an empire And at first this empire is extremely innovative Why for three reasons Okay The first thing is that it now has scale Okay It has size Therefore it's able to draw in more resources Second is the idea of standardization St synization just means that now you're using the same monitor system you're using the same laws you're using the same uh communications network Okay that allows for better use of resources The last is the idea of centralization meaning that you have one place controlling all activities elsewhere And that allows you to build canals that allows you to build temples that allows you to to undertake massive public works projects Okay So in the beginning of the empire there's massive consolidation of innovation which leads to tremendous innovation Okay But over time what happens is the empire becomes the opposite of an open cooperative competition system Why well first of all it come becomes insular Okay Then it becomes secretive and then it becomes a monopoly That's what a bureaucracy is Hey do you guys understand okay Yeah All right So when an empire reaches a certain point of growth it becomes a bureaucracy and therefore it kills all innovation So this idea that civilization leads to innovation is wrong Okay Civilization leads ultimately to corruption All right Now um what's interesting is that even though this is a general rule of human development it's not always true There are exceptions Okay So for example one civilization that we know that did not work out like this is something called the Indis Valley civilization which is modern day Pakistan And we'll discuss this later on but they were actually even though they had a city-state system they were actually peaceful egalitarian and artistic Okay they didn't go to war with each other They didn't create a hierarchy They didn't create a bureaucracy And we'll discuss later on why this is the case But this is something that you need to understand Even though there are patterns to human history there are always exceptions to the rule Okay all right So um over time the empire breaks down Okay Why because you have a hierarchy in place Okay hierarchy a bureaucracy the people are at the bottom And if you are a person in empire your life sucks Okay it really sucks because you're essentially a slave Why well first of all the empire goes to war a lot in order to protect its advantages Okay so they can at any time just take you to war and you get killed Okay Second is the problem of debt It's very easy if you um are a peasant to fall in debt You owe rent to a landlord then you have to sell your children Okay so debt really sucks Um and the last problem is immob immobility which just means that you're just stuck where you are Okay so the people in the empire their lives suck but they're stuck where they are because of war debt and immobility Okay And as we discussed last class uh the bureaucracy will develop a methodology in order to just justify why they are like this Okay But at the very top it's it's actually even more problematic because what happens is at the top you'll eventually have a problem of elite over production Okay elite over production just means that there are only a few limited spots for the elite and the elite have too many children and therefore they fight Okay they break up into different factions and each faction competes against each other for the right to be the elite And because of this conflict at the very top you usually have three results Okay the first result is revolution where one elite tells the people to overthrow everyone else Okay so remember what's really important to understand is the people do not um create the revolution The people themselves do not rebel It's always one faction of the elite help um working with the people to overall the other factions Okay that's what a revolution is Second possibility is civil war Okay where the factions um have different armies and they fight And the third possibility is just they go to war with the empire Okay but uh this is a common pattern in history Now what's really interesting is that as the empire falls the pastoral people come and take over the empire Okay the step people or the pastoralists Pashu just means that they don't farm for a living They raise sheep goats and cows for a living Okay they come and they take over the empire Why is this the case because these people are the best fighters in the world They have horses They can they have they have they're archers Okay so they're the best fighters in the world So what often happens is one faction invites them to be mercenaries in the struggle and eventually they re recognize you know what we don't have to fight for the prince we can take over take over over ourselves Another thing that happens is the faction that invites the mercenaries don't have enough money to pay them off So the mercenaries are just like screw this we'll just take over the empire ourselves Okay Um and what's important to understand is that throughout all this the pastoralists are always in contact of the empire through three things okay through trade through uh pillaging So the pastors come and steal from the people and through being mercenaries okay so this is a pattern throughout human history So now the question we have to ask is why are the pastoralists so different from people of civilization and empire and the reason is geography What I will show you is that people who are passionless grow up in a different environment than the people of civilization empire and therefore they they de a different economy as well as mythology as well as culture Okay All right All right Let's continue But we're clear so far right okay So um in the beginning we had agriculture Why do we have agriculture because as we discussed before uh people came together for religious purposes They built temples and now you have to maintain the temples Therefore you build farms around the temple and develop agriculture Okay But because of climate change and overpopulation people always constantly forced to move to new places So agriculture was first up in the Middle East and then it went over to Europe and it went over to um other places as well Okay So it spread around the world So when they went to Europe they could actually maintain their agricultural practices because the climate and the geography and the terrain of Europe was conducive to agriculture And as a result Europe maintained the cultural practices of the people of the Middle East Okay and so they had egalitarian artistic and peaceful civilizations Okay So why they were peaceful is that first of all women were in control Okay Remember it's the most natural thing to have women be part of the political class Okay So women were in charge So if there's any conflict the women would just discuss it among amongst themselves and come to a harmonious conclusion Okay they wouldn't have to fight Second thing is there was no money because there was no property Okay the agriculture is something that you work on together and you share You don't there's no such concept as private property Okay so in other words no war no conflict So these are the three distinct characteristics of early human society In an agricultural society women are usually in command There's no sense of private property Everyone shares everything together and there's no conflict in no war People just discuss things and trade in order to reach a harmonious conclusion Okay So um what this changes is that the city grows and grows and then you have a large city and so you need a bureaucracy Okay But in Europe what's really important to understand about Europe is that unlike China and Egypt and most of Britannia it does not have a large river and therefore you cannot grow a big city in Europe Okay so that allows them to maintain a pretty good life Okay so when they go to Europe they're able to maintain the same cultural practices but then they go to the steps Okay and the problem with steps is you cannot grow food because it's all grass land Okay you cannot farm So now you have to change your cultural practice So what was happening is that these people in the steps they started to trade with people of agriculture Okay Also you have people in in the agriculture who moved to the steps and they brought with them cows and sheep and this changed everything because you as a person you can't eat grass but cows and sheep can So now what you can do is you can base your entire economy around animals as opposed to agriculture Okay Well there's certain problems with cows and sheep Okay The first problem is that they're expensive So now you have a concept of private property money And this concept didn't really exist before Okay and so if I see someone with a cow I don't I don't have a cow What do I do i want to go steal it Right so this leads to conflict now war and conflict And because you have private property and war and conflict you can't have a system run by woman You need a system run by men This creates a patriarchy Okay so this is a very important principle in human history These three things go together Okay patriarchy money and war Okay these three three things always go together Patriarchy money and war Okay so um this is changing the economy of the steps and it's d in and it's and it's becoming different from agricultural societies Okay And now so now they need innovations in in order to deal with a new economy Okay So let's go over some of their major innovations The first major innovation that's very important is the idea of lactose tolerance You may not know this but most humans cannot drink milk naturally Okay so you need to develop the enzymes to drink milk naturally And so they were able to do that because they were forced to rely on cows and sheep for their food They had to learn how to drink milk But when they learned how to drink milk when they learned how to eat when when they started eating meat guess what they became stronger and taller Okay so for most of you in history the people of the steps were the tallest people in the world They were the strongest in the world Okay that's the first major innovation that changed their history The second major innovation is horse riding Why because the steps are a huge area and it's flat so you can so you need to move around it a lot Also remember cows and sheep eat grass So when they eat this in this pasture and they finish all their grass they have to move somewhere else Okay So the only way to protect your cows and sheep from other people is to be mobile And so they learn how to domesticate horses Okay which is a major invasion and it took a long time And you can imagine how hard that is to do because if horses see you what do they do they run away So how do you train a horse to not run away and let the horse ride you well it takes a lot and lot of effort But because they had to do it they managed to do it Okay and so with the horse riding now you can have another invention which is the wheel and the wagon Wheel and wagon Now you can put all your stuff in a wagon and move from camp to camp Okay you can cover the entirety of the steps Okay does that make sense yes Okay and because of these three major innovations you now have a different culture Okay so let's go over what makes their culture distinctive from other places Okay the first is the idea of patriarchy where um men are in control and the reason why they're control is because in the steps war is a constant thing Okay So the culture becomes very masculine very aggressive It rewards aggression It rewards courage Okay Um the other thing is that when you have a patriarchy in place you can have more children Okay When women are in charge women tend to practice birth control because they want to make sure that every child is healthy and every every child lives to adulthood Okay they want to avoid the risk of dying in child birth They want they want to avoid the risk of their of their child dying young Okay but with men are in charge they basically get women to have as many kids as possible Okay also remember in this world there's a lot of conflict So you need as many uh boys to fight as possible Okay but then you have a problem then if you have a lot of children what is what what you have a problem of inheritance like when you die your cows go to who right now let's assume you have 100 cows you have like 10 boys if you give if you if you are fair and you give 10 cows to one boy well very quickly your family is going to be poor and because in the steps the weather is bad your cows are very likely to die Well then your entire family could be extinct in two or three generations So they invented a new concept called primogenature Primogenature Primogenature just means that the eldest boy inherits everything that ensures that the family can stay can stay wealthy Okay All right Now but now your problem is wait a minute If the eldest boy inherits everything what do the other boys do well they have to go and steal other cows Okay and to do that they form secret societies Okay secret societies are just like basically just gangs Okay these gangs of young men who get together to do what well they go steal cows and sheep And what else do they do they steal woman Right Because Right Right i mean like what's the most most valuable commodity in the steps well cows and woman So that's what you steal Okay So this creates a culture of war and conflict constantly All right And the third innovation is something called the patron client relationship And this is actually how or patronage And this is what allows for the construction of society in the steps So remember in a civilization you have bureaucracy You have centralization But in the steps you can't have that because you can't have that many people So you have a patron client relationship And all that means is that uh it's like a mafia right i'm the big brother you're the little brother So maybe I have 100 cows and you need cows So I lend you 10 cows But now you're you are loyal to me Okay i'm the big brother you're the little brother And this creates the idea of tribes Okay does that make sense what's really important here is that in civilization um bureaucracy maintains control over people over debt And so you become a slave but in the steps there's no concept of slavery Okay you're still a free and independent person but you just pay you're just loyal to your big brother So your big brother needs you to do something you go do it for him Okay so there's still a level of freedom in the steps that you don't have in civilization And that's why they're such good fighters Okay all right So these three things are major um innovations But now that you have these innovations you need a new methodology to justify or explain these innovations Okay And so what they had was a they went from the mother goddess Okay So mother goddess again is the religion of agriculture people to the sky god And the mother goddess wants you to be harmonious Okay To be kind and compassionate What does the sky go want you to do the sky god wants you to conquer and exploit Okay it wants you to destroy It wants you to kill It wants you to conquer to steal Okay and um also in this religion horses and cows are very important But as we discussed last class here grain and nature are very important Okay So you see how this works right now what's important to understand is that because um this system does not allow for the creation of a bureaucracy the steps always practice open cooperative competition And it's a system that forces you to be aggressive It forces you to be independent Okay and it forces you to work hard And that's why people the steps are the greatest warriors in human history And that's why when the steps people encounter the empire civilization they usually are able to conquer the empire Okay does that make sense okay So the steps are like a training ground for fighters and over time the fighters just become more and more fierce and what's ironic is those fighters who are the most fierce can stay in the steps Those fighters who are forced out the steps they go conquer the empire Okay All right It's a constant pattern in human history All right Is that clear all right Any questions guys before I do the PPT great Okay guys Yes So sorry Can can you speak to the mic please so earlier you said that um uh these these people they inherit their uh to their oldest son right so so my question is uh like is it like necessary for or um so they must inherit their inheritance to the oldest son or is it like they have some kind of a system to uh determine what which son can have the best of their inheritance Okay Yeah So their general principle is always the eldest son Okay That's to avoid conflict because if you open up to say okay well who's whoever is most brave whoever is most um noble whoever who is most wise that means that they'll just fight each other okay and this is what happened after the death of Genghask Khan right so the general rule is you always give it to the eldest son but what if the eldest son has been manipulated by his uh siblings it doesn't matter it does not matter okay all right so legacy of the steps all All right So as I discussed what's happening is that Europe um at first was just hunter gatherer and they were spread out They did paintings in caves They had a pretty easy life Okay not an easy life but it was a free life And over time what would happen is that agriculture would develop in the Middle East and it would spread to Europe Okay okay And you can see the genetic change where the blue is hunter gatherer and the orange is farmers Okay But then what happened um in about 2500 B.CE is the steps people who we call the Yamna actually So there's different names They're protoindo-uropeans The Yamnia you can refer to them as any Okay Steps Yamnia Portal Indo-Uropean it doesn't really matter But they go to Europe as well and they start mixing with the um farmers What's really important for our purpose purpose to understand is this When the farmers went to Europe they went as families husband wife children And so they integrated into Europe pretty peacefully Okay But when the pastoralists the Yamaya went to Europe they went mostly as young men Therefore that they kill the local men in order to marry their wives Okay and so basically um from DNA research we know that it was a genocide Okay The uh European farming men were eliminated by the pastoralists Okay And we have always remember that the pachlist they were stronger Okay They were taller um and they're more aggressive Okay All right Yeah So this is another map that shows the same thing What you need to understand is this This movement is global Okay So the farmers went to Europe but they also went to India and Iran Okay they basically went wherever they could go Same thing with the Yamaya Okay so this this is the Yamaya people They went to Europe but they also look at this they also went to Iran and India And we know because when we study the languages uh Persian okay Hindi and European languages they're basically the same languages So we know there had to be one common mother language to them Okay So there's another map showing you the Yaya again Um they went to Europe but they also went to in India Okay As well as Iran and by mixing with local uh customs and religion they created new religions that had tremendous impact on world civilization So in um Iran they will give birth to Zorashianism which we'll discuss later on Okay And the these are the Avestas which is the Bible of of Zarastrianism and uh India they uh of course gave birth to Hinduism um and these are the vidas which is a bible of Hinduism we'll discuss this later on in the semester but I want you to be aware of this okay so again we know that this happened at first because of linguistic studies when we looked at different languages we discovered there are common words to them so look let's look at father okay when Latin is patar Greek patus Persian Padar Hindi Pitha Pretty similar Okay Similar mother mother matar mitra madar mad So we so from different lingu linguistic studies we know they had to be a common language to all of them And that's why we hypothesize about the protoindo-uropeans Um this is even more stark example where the protoindo-uropean 2 is dual Okay And you can see how it spreads to other languages in the protoindo-uropean family So that you go from uh dua to tua to two in English Okay so all these languages are interrelated That's why if you speak one like English it's pretty easy for you to learn the other languages as well Whereas if you speak Chinese it doesn't really help you when you go learn other languages Okay All right Now linguist linguists have done studies of words that are distinct to protoindouropean and these are the words that they discovered Okay B cow ox ram eel dog grain cauldron wrestling wealth households families clans These words are unique to their culture And therefore we're able to group these words together and discover there are four characteristics Okay first of lots of words for wheel They have words for uh dairy They don't have farming terms and they have words for horse Okay that's why we're able to figure out that these are nomadic pasturalists Therefore they must be from the steps Okay and then through archaeology and DNA DNA studies we're able to have a better understanding of who they are Okay and as I said they have to be past Okay because of the way they use words Um so let's about old Europe before the Yami come and conquer them Okay so this is Maria Gmbhutas who is an American Lutheranian anthropologist and she's the first to hypothesize that old Europe must have been conquered by these people because she did a lot of archa archaeology and discovered that their culture was primarily uh peaceful It honored women and it exposed egotarinism Okay this is exactly what I said previously and the Yama people were completely different They were a patriarchy quite a part of property and which was very aggressive Okay Um she wrote many books um the language of the goddess and she like her work is amazing Okay So if you have a chance please do study her work and um so let's write let's read what she wrote Okay So this is a mother god of civilization Something that we we thought we've discussed a lot in this class The goddess in our manifestations was a symbol of the unity of all life in nature Her power was in water and stone in tomb and cave in animals and birds snakes and fish hills trees and flowers Hence the holistic and mythopoic perception of all the sacredness and mystery of all there is on earth Okay So again this is a religion that practice balance and harmony because everything is sacred Therefore you cannot destroy life without first getting permission from the mother goddess Okay This culture took deep delight in the natural wonders of this world Its people did not produce lethal weapons or build forts in inacceptable places as her successors did even when they were acquainted with metallurgy Instead they built magnificent tombs shrines and temples comfortable house in moderatelysized villages and created superb pottery and sculptures This was a long-lasting period of remarkable creativity and stability and age free of strife Their culture was a culture of art Okay so this is a very nice place They don't fight They're egalitarian They practice art Okay And what's really important for us to understand is they had writing systems They had m they had technology They just chose not to use it for war because it was against their religion Um so they they also had writing systems and they had symbols Okay And this is something that u Mares has done a lot of research in Okay I won't go into their writing system Um so when the came they basically completely invert the culture So for example the Europeans the old Europeans believed that the snake was symbol of life energy and regeneration A most benevolent non evil creature It was a Y who introduced the idea that the snake is a devil Okay All right And that's where we get the B and that's where we get the concept in the Bible from Um black to them is a good color White is a bad color Why because black symblies life White symbolizes death Right black did not mean death or the underworld It was a color of fertility The color of damp caves and rich soil of the womb of the goddess where life begins White on the other hand was the color of death of bones Okay And again when the come they will invert this Um what's really important to understand is in this society women are in control They have power and agency And why well it turns out that um this book Sex and Dawn Sex at Dawn Okay It turns out that women are just um better at man managing social relationships than men are Okay So this is Sex at Dawn by Christopher Ryan And um he tries to show us that for most of human history women had sexual agency And one piece of evidence is the fact that human men have larger penises In fact the largest penises of all primates Okay so gorillas are much bigger than we are We have bigger penises Why because um we have to compete in order to put our semen into women right because women have multiple sexual partners So that's one major advantage of sexual freedom for women Men have bigger penises Okay All right Um even when women had long-term intimate partners husbands they had se sexual partners Okay So the idea is that for most of human history love and sex were not the same thing Love is intimacy Sex is just fun Okay Um in some societies women would have many husbands usually brothers Okay that's a way to maintain peace and harmony in your society Okay If a woman is allowed to marry many brothers together Okay All right So um the book looks at the mill million people where they practice um sexual freedom for women and the explanation is that semen was essential to human growth and development Okay So so if a bride got married then all the men would come and impregnate her because the idea is that semen is sacred and they want to give her as much life as possible Okay All right Now you may be disgusted by this okay but I think there's a very good counter-argument Okay So the argument is that I is that it's not honorable for a woman to love anyone except her husband and that this evil being among them he himself was not sure that his son who was there present was his son Okay so the system sucks because if you're a guy how do you know that that person is your son and the natives respond by saying you French people okay so he's talking about the French missionary you French people love only your own children but we all love all the children of our tribe Okay So that's what what humans can do We can love each other There's no limit to our love So in the system that we have today a patriarchy we only love our own children But in their system the agent system everyone loved each other's children Okay everyone loved all children And quite honestly in this system it's better to be a a child right and in this system you would never ever develop depression Okay all right Again women are just better politicians than men because women are more willing to cooperate Women have more emotional intelligence and women can use sex and gossip as mechanism of control Okay so this is all pretty common sense right all right But then question then is if this world is so wonderful why did it collapse well there are three major issues with agriculture societies Okay The first major issue is that it's static It does not innovate Second major issue is climate change If the weather changes on you you're screwed The third problem is disease right because you're living close to animals You're living close together So if a disease hits you you're all screwed Okay and that's very different from the p from the seps people who live far apart from each other Okay all right So we know that in Europe the farmer communities uh the population went collapsed Okay So so this is the level of carbon dioxide in the air We can measure the level of carbon dioxide in the year We know that in about the year 3000 BCE the population collapsed Okay All right It collapsed everywhere in Europe Why this happened the plague guys Okay That's a problem with being a farmer You are always susceptible to the plague So we know that maybe you know um 4,000 5,000 years ago a plague broke out Okay The black death basically by rats Okay And remember in this world we trade with each other So the black death was able to go everywhere and wipe out farming communities Okay even spread as far as China Okay but but the thing though is the the steps people are not as impacted because they live far apart from each other So if one got the disease you're not going to spread it to your entire family or sorry your entire community whereas a farmer community they will Okay so there's this huge drop in the population because of black death in Europe Okay that's number one Number two is climate change So we know that um now and then there's this huge climate change and that destroys our culture forcing people to migrate and this is what we suspect happened in old Europe as well Okay And so what's happening now is that because your society is static because of disease because of climate change the population in Europe went all the way down leaving the MI opportunity to come invade Okay And they did come invade So as you can see uh when the agricultural people came they came as families okay so the so the blue is the man the red is the woman okay so uh one to one they go into Europe but when the yama come they come as young men okay so it's mainly blue okay and of course what do young men do they come and they steal your woman okay that's what young men guy do do guys all right and over time what they will do is slowly establish new cultures because what's happening is that their culture is blending with other cultures as well and why this is happening is the geography is different right so in the steps they have a certain culture but when they move to our culture they now have to combine their culture with the local ones and this happens in um everywhere producing different cultures and producing different languages as well okay so all of Europe was radically transformed be because of this migration and again this migration it was basically a genocide So you look at Britain okay the people who built Stonehenge are gone This is a farming agricultural community worship the monoliths okay and all this wonderful scientific technology that's now lost to us because what would happen is the Mi would come and kill everyone Okay so this the blue is the farmer people the red is Na total genocide Okay guys men and women were all killed Why because maybe they chose the men and women chose to fight together Okay um in Spain it's a different story because um what happened is that all the men will be replaced Okay So the white chromosome is the male chromosome So before the year 2000 BCE uh you had a lot of blue right but as you can see if you move further it's all gone They killed all the men in Spain Okay When they went to India it's a different story because India Indians in that time were more peaceful So they came to a settlement where the new conquerors would be at the top society and the people would be and the locals would be at the bottom Okay So there wasn't that much of a genocide but we can we had a cast system created because of that Okay And we know because if you look at the upper cast they all spoke Indo-Uropean If you look at the lower cast people they spoke the local language Dravenian Okay Does that make sense so depending on the circumstance uh the result is different All right Okay This is a wonderful book called The Horse the Will and Language written by David Anthony who's a Harvard anthropologist and he explains to us the Naya culture and why they were so dominant Okay So one thing um that is unique to the Amnia is their mythology It's a mythology of violence of struggle of dominance of conquest Okay and how the mythology works is in the beginning there were two brothers twins one named man and the other named twin They go around by the world and they're accompanied by a great cow Eventually man and twin decided to create the world we now inhabit Due to this man had to sacrifice twin Okay he had to kill his own brother the person he loved in order to create the world And the gods thanked him for that The gods blessed him for that Okay so this is a world that is pretty violent Okay Um after world was made the sky gods gave cattle to third men But the cattle were stolen by a three-headed six-eyed serpent Okay The snake Third men entreat intreated the storm Got to help get the cattle back together They went to the cattle um of the monsters killed it and freed the cattle Okay So this is a mythology of struggle Okay And what's really interesting is that this mythology becomes the the mythology of all new uh protoindo European civilizations including the Romans and the Mongolians Okay So this is Genghask Khan His mythology is what he kills his best friend to become the leader of the Mongol people And what's the Roman mythology ramlas kills his twin brother to found Rome Okay All right So that shows you that the Mongols and the Romans they come from the same culture Okay a culture based on violence and exploitation All right So now Anthony talks about the economy Domesticated cattle and sheep started a revolutionary change in how humans exploited the pontiac caspian step environment Because cattle and sheep were cultured like humans they were part of everyday work and worry in a way never approached by wild animals Humans identify with their cattle and sheep wrote poetry about them and use them as currency in marriage gifts debt payments and the calculation of social status Okay now we have the beginning of money and property right and they were grass processors They converted plains of grass useless and even hostile to humans into wool fed clothing tents milk yogurt cheese meat marrow and bone The foundation of both life and wealth Cattle and sheep herds can grow rapidly with a little luck Vulnerable to bad weather and theft They can also decline rapidly Hurting was a volatile boom bust economy and required a flexible opportunistic social organization So they live in a world of tremendous volatility because the entire world was a cattle If the cattle died because of a bad storm or because of bad luck they were completely screwed Okay Okay So they they were very aggressive people and they um were opportunistic as well That's different from farmers who can just afford to sit back and relax because nature will grow the food for them Okay The connection between animals brothers and power was a foundation on which new forms of male-centered ritual and politics developed among Indo-Uropean speaking societies This is why the cow and brothers occupied such a central place in Indo-Uropean myths relating to how the world began Okay So this is a deeply patriarchal society All right All right Participation in long-d distanceance trade give exchange and a new set of cults requiring public sacrifices and feasting became the foundation for a new kind of social power Stock breeding is by nature a volatile economy Herders who lose animals always borrow from those who still have them The social obligations associated with these loans are institutionalized among the world's pastoralists as a basis for a fluid system of status distinctions Those who loan animals acquired power over those who borrow them and those who sponsored fees obligate their guests Early protoindouropean include a vocabulary about verbal contracts bound by oath used in later religious rituals to speify the obligations between the weak and the strong Okay All right So the idea here is there's no slavery in the system Okay But there is obligation There is loyalty If I take you out for a meal guess what now you owe me a meal If I take you out for a meal you now I'm now your big brother Okay and that's what keeps the society cohesive And this is important because if no one's a slave and everyone's free then everyone is a great warrior because you're fighting for yourself Okay you're not fighting because someone asked you to That's why in wars between empires and these people these people usually win Okay because they're much more motivated All right wealth military power and a more productive hurting system probably brought prestige and power to the identities associated with protoindouropean dialects After 33 BC the gas host institution extended the protections of old bound obligations to new social groups An Indo-Uropean speaking patron could accept and integrate outsiders as clients without shaming them or assigning them permanently to submissive roles as long as they conducted the sacrifices properly Praise posture of public feast encouraged patrons to be generous and validated the language of the songs as a vehicle for communication with the gods who regulated everything Okay So another way of saying this is that even though there are wealthy people and poor people they are still treated with respect Okay Okay it's a very egalitarian society Okay and what keeps the system in place is the belief in the gods Okay the belief that if I do you a favor then you owe me the favor We have a contract now The gods oversee the contracts And what's really important is that this is an open-ended system So it's easy for me to bring in more people into this system Okay Okay Okay And that's how and that's why again they were such an innovative cohesive and open society Okay The last thing we'll talk about are these um young men who enter secret societies Okay And enter secret societies and become um you know like this mafia gangs Okay The institution of the Morabon the warrior brotherhood of young men bound by oath to one another and to ancestors during a ritually mandated raid has been reconstructed as a central part of protoindouropean initiation rituals Okay It's a very important part of society because these young men otherwise have no place to go Okay And if you if you want to know who they are they're basically the Vikings Okay So the Vikings are the direct um descendants of these people Okay All right All right So let's talk about the the Mongols The Mongols conquered the world most of the world And they and the question is how do they do it okay And I've already told the answer Okay because the steps people have always been good at conquering empires Um these are the Mongols Uh the secret weapon of course is a horse archer This is like the ultimate weapon for most of human history You could you could not defend against a horse archer They were fast they were strong um and these were the best warriors in the world So um this has been considered a pattern in human history First the Yamaya came and conquered Europe India and Iran But then you have the cythians Okay same place same people same culture Um guys this is not a race of people This is a culture of people Okay because remember at this time in human history genetic exchange is very common Okay the cyians were dominant Then you have the medians who would later on give rise to the Persian Empire Okay sorry Oops Okay Sorry Okay Then you had So can can you see this okay So now what's going to happen is is this You're gonna have you're gonna so the steps people are all around the grassland Now China emerges as an empire and this is the Han Empire and this is really the last Chinese dynasty Why because they are ethnically Chinese and they're proud of who they are So what they're going to do is they're going to try to destroy the Sepsible once and for all Okay so they move a huge army into the steps to try to limit the threat And what what happens now is it forces a cascade effect where these people are now forced to go westwards which which forces them with people over here Okay And so you have this huge migration all the way to the Roman Empire Okay Okay So this is what the map shows us Okay China forces the Huns the Shunu westwards which then forces these other groups to go elsewhere Okay So again the strongest people stay in the steps The weakest people go and conquer empires Okay this is a process of constant innovation Um the the Han Empire Okay Han Then you have the Turks emerge Um uh this is the Mongol Empire and as you can see they conquered basically most of the world Okay Um and because they conquer most of the world and the world is is unified then you have the black death Okay which wipes out most of Europe as well About a third of Europe is wiped out in the black death Okay And the last great conqueror is Timberlane Okay Timber the lane The great last great conqueror of the from the steps um and he conquers most of the world Okay So this is really important principle Remember the steps people are the most innovative the most open the most aggressive the most courageous and that's why they're the greatest conquerors in history Okay But eventually what happens is we develop gunpowder Okay and now the steps will be conquered by civilization But this was the turning point in history the event of gunpowder And so now what's going to happen is that civilization will now attack the steps people and reduce the step people culture Okay And that is it Right Okay Any questions guys um so so I was wondering like uh so the bombarians the steps are they're capable of developing uh re religions like because they are all conquering all around the world so it's difficult for them to like build up temples right okay so religions don't require temples religion is just collective belief so as I say as I keep on saying in this class all humans have a religion Okay a religion is just a worldview understanding of how the world works That answers three questions Where do we come from why are we here where are we going okay even today even though we're atheists we're still religious Okay but we worship money materialism science So these people the steps they worship the horse the sky god the cow they worship war they worship um courage and bravery Okay So every culture every person has a religion of some sorts because because you because it's impossible for you to understand the world and operate in the world without a religion Okay especially for groups Okay any more questions okay great guys So we'll so we'll continue our discussion of human history next class Okay
