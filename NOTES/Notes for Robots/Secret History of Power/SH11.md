so today we start a series on the entirety of human history we'll be going very fast and again what's important is for you to understand the concepts and so if there are ideas you don't understand it's very important that you raise your hand challenge me and ask for clarification so we start off with the dawn of humanity and um this is Charles Darwin and arguably he is the most influential thinker of the past 20 years and the reason why is he wrote a book called the origin of species and he presents to us the theory of evolution and you all know the theory of evolution because they teach this to you in school and is embedded in our everyday lives and there are three main ideas to the theory of evolution the first is that it was all accidental so you have these genetic mutations and the mutation that is best fitted to survive in environment would win out okay so it's all a random accidental process that's the first thing second thing is that it is materialistic meaning everything that you can see is all that exists and the third thing is it is emergent meaning that feel things build on top of each other it is a bottomup process now the the fear of evolution marked a turning point in in human history because before um European countries were Christian and Christians believe that there was a divine God who created us and as such we were all equal before the eyes of God therefore you cannot go and enslave other people you cannot go and kill other people as well there were three main ideas to Christianity okay okay the first idea is one omniscient and omnipresent God the spirit the Holy Spirit is what infuses uh life it's what gives meaning and purpose to life and the world is a mystery we have to hold faith there are things that we cannot understand god has a plan but it is a mysterious plan and so we must uh be humble and serve the purpose of God okay and the theory of evolution destroys this concept conception of the universe and introduces a more materialistic one so why did this happen well it happened for three reasons the main purp the main reason is that we live in an in the 19th century when Darism came into being Europeans were engaged in a process of imperialism they were going around the world and conquering other people and colonizing other people and essentially committing genocide so they needed a theory to explain why this this happening and Darwin's theory of surround the fittest was the most appropriate theory and the idea is that the world is divided into races and of and the white race is superior to everyone else and therefore the white race um has reason has legitimacy in colonizing other people um and evolution would give rise to racism and eugenics okay so before Darwinism we didn't really have a concept of race because everyone was equal in the eyes of God and now with the rise of Darwinism the world is divided according to race as well because of evolution theory people started to believe in eugenics which is the idea that stupid people people who are not white they should be sterilized because if we if we let them live they would just all they would do is dilute the genetic pool okay and even today guys there are still many people who believe in racism and eugenics the thing about evolution that's very important is that it's a theology okay what does that mean means that it's a theory of human progress about God so even though evolution thinks that genetic mutation is an accident the theology is that well the strong survive and that's what's right okay so might makes right so in many ways evolution is a rejection of Christianity so you would think that Christians would oppose Darwinism and evolutionary theory but what was surprising is that when the book came out in 1859 only in 20 years the theory of evolution would come to dominate the entire western world it be it became the dominant idea in schools in universities in the sciences and even today evolution is a dominant paradigm meaning that you cannot question evolution if you question evolution it means you're crazy okay but I'm crazy so we're going to question evolution today all right so you've said this in school all but evolution means we came from monkeys apes and then there were different species of humans and eventually the best our species the homo sapiens won out okay so what evolution says is that we are just a monkey guys okay we're just a monkey and what do monkeys do monkeys like to have sex monkeys like to eat monkeys like to fart that's all we are we're just monkeys all right and this is the evolutionary tree of primates the but there are certain problems with this theory okay the first problem is if you look at evolutionary theory what you should have is tremendous diversity as the species develops but so why is it that we only have one human species okay why aren't there many different ones well the argument is that um there are there were many different species before but we want out okay okay that's fine but another problem is why are we going all around the world okay so all species of human beings like to migrate but primates don't do that why is that humans like to migrate and so the explanation often is well because of climate change because of war because humans are chasing game okay bisonens and and and food but then how do you explain these people okay the these are people who went to populate the Pacific islands Micronia that's kind of weird first of all it's really dangerous to go out the Pacific for months and months right also like how do they know that there'll be islands waiting for them in the Pacific so that's something that's very odd about human beings in fact there are lots of things that are really odd about us that other animals don't do for example we're very religious okay okay so the Neanthods are supposed to be before Homo sapiens but as you can see what we've discovered are these religious ritual sites the Neanthals where the anthos engage in religious ritual practice that's kind of weird what does religion have to do with survival in fact you can argue that religion is a waste of time why aren't they hunting why are they using so so much resources and time in building these uh ritual sites okay Homo sapiens did cave paintings and these cave paintings I will show you later on they're very extremely elaborate as you can see it's very time consuming uh to actually do these paintings also these paintings are in caves deep inside caves that's very cold and where there isn't much ear so it's kind of dangerous actually to be in these places but we know that homo sapiens spend a lot of time in these deep wet caves drawing these paintings that's not very utarian why would we why would we do that so that's a mystery okay also um when we drew on caves we figured out how to make it artistic so we figure out that red ochre would give us red yellow pigment on the caves we also use charcoal to use black okay so we were very creative we were very we resourceful all right so we know a lot about the ice age because as you can imagine during the ice age things freeze over so they can be easily preserved and actually for most of human history uh we were in the ice age period okay and as you can see during the ice age the entire world was basically frozen over so how did we survive we survived by using the resources around us okay so this is a mammoth and so they killed a mammoth and they turned the mammoth into a house okay now the question is how did they know how to do that how did they figure it out and we've been trying for a long time to figure this out but my answer to you and this is a theme that I will uh keep on emphasizing for the rest of the rest of semester is they just knew it okay so let's do a thought experiment let's just say that we there's 10 of us and I give you this wall right and I say to you you cannot talk you cannot communicate with each other all I want you to do is draw a picture now you would think that the picture would be disgustingly ugly it would be incoherent but if you actually to do this experiment something weird and wonderful would happen okay there's 10 of you you're not communicating you don't have a plan there's no draft but one of you would draw something okay and then the rest of you would see that something and then you would draw something else okay so for example maybe you draw a sun then you draw a tree then that other person draws a mountain okay it's almost like telepathy and that's how we are if you put humans in a group they would know instantly how to work together they would know how to share ideas together and so that's the idea I want to present to you all this stuff is all all this is because of intuition okay no one said "Hey there's a mammoth let's go kill it for food and for housing and for clothing." But if you walk together and you saw a man you all of you together had the same thought oh that could be a source of food and clothing and shelter for us and you all knew how to work together that's the beauty of the human imagination and the human empathy and that's something that back then they practice a lot but we've lost because of civilization okay does that make sense to you guys all right um and as you can see back then humans were just very good at working together no there you didn't have need to have a boss to say "Okay you should go and hunt bisons you should go and you should make clothes you should go and you should feed kids." Everyone knew exactly what to do and you didn't have to communicate but also what's really interesting about this time period is the diversity of human organization so what I meant by that what what I mean by that is that in different times of the year in different locations humans would form different organizations so most of the time maybe there'll be groups of like five to 10 would go and get food okay but then you have some times of the year when you have these religious festivals where hundreds possibly thousands got together and you celebrated your god together it was all intuitive you didn't have communication but they all knew at what time what organization would best fit them if you didn't like the situation guess what you'd go somewhere else and start your own organization okay so mo early human history it's a very diverse very dynamic very creative period in our lives even though we've forgotten about it okay and the third example of our creativity are these cave paintings that that were discovered uh recently but which date back 30,000 40,000 years okay you can see how beautiful these paintings are whoever painted these paintings put a lot of care and devotion into them okay it was it's not just kids playing it's adults who spent a long time purposefully ensuring that every detail is exact okay then the question then is how do they do this because there's no paper there's no planning and again I present to you the idea the imagination they dreamt this they had a dream they saw the picture in their heads and they went and drew this in a cave because they wanted to express themselves they wanted to leave a legacy they wanted to leave a memory there's a calling in you to be creative and to be imaginative okay all right so and you can see there's a lot of diversity um this is a story right because you have these uh horses but then you have these predators lions okay so this picture is telling a mythology it's a telling a story of how nature works okay so people are observing nature and what they see is a cycle of life and death of destruction and renewal we're all together we're all unified we're all one it's balance and harmony and that's why if you were to kill these animals you also had to commemorate them okay does that make sense okay because this this is a word of balance and harmony if you kill these animals and you eat their food you must thank them for the sacrifice by commemorating them the same thing as later on uh when humans fight in battles we build monuments to celebrate those those who were fallen right because we want to create balance and harmony in the world we want to commemorate those who made our lives possible okay so in this world what matters are these animals because these animals are what gives humans food um and clothing okay okay you can see how beautiful these pictures are like you do you see how lifelike the animals are okay so clearly we humans had all this creative potential back then all right okay this is in Spain when Alamera this is a bison and you can see the red ochre how beautiful it is okay okay and you can see how it's not meant to be realistic it's meant to be surreal it's meant almost to be a mythology there's there's there's a story being told in these pictures we don't know what the story is but you can imagine that there's story of life and death destruction and renewal okay and you can see the struggle of humanity to get food from nature but also a willingness to celebrate those who have fallen um and there's religious significance to everything these campaignings how do we know because this is clearly a shaman right what we call a leper man this dates back to 40,000 years in Germany so we believe that in the early societies the shamans were the leaders because they had the most wisdom because they had a connection to the vine also what's really important is that music okay this instrument was really important to these to these civilizations now there's a lot of mystery as to how we first spoke and as I said actually we don't really need to speak because we can all understand each other so why do we speak because we want to sing okay does that make sense singing creating music was a way to express ourselves in the same way as painting was and music once you add words it becomes storytelling and that's why we created language okay not for economic reasons not in order to create a hierarchy but for creative reasons to celebrate our humanity together and these pictures as you can see there are um religious elements okay so you can see how there are two almost bird figures and um back then the bird signify mother earth okay so the bird figure is very important you can see almost like the bird figures are leading the animals uh hurting the animals across so then ask yourself why are they why are these paintings appearing in caves well for these people they all believe that um nature was connected right and the spirit world and material world were connected together so then the question then is how does the spirit world connect with the material world well through caves right through portals rivers caves mountaintops and that's why these places were considered appropriate sites for religious ritual okay and that's why you painted these pictures in caves because these caves you it's almost like you're summoning the spirit of these animals to return right you've killed these animals how do you get them to return by calling for them in these caves right right so as you can see it's a complex but a complete mythology of how the world works and for them this was very real okay and you can see how these shamans would actually turn themselves into these bees in order to better communicate with them okay because these bees these animals these bisonens were the basis for all life on Earth if you didn't have them then you would die off so you dressed up like them in order to better communicate with them in the spirit world to draw them back okay okay so this is another religious depiction all right so these cave paintings there's always three questions associated with these cave paintings the first is how are they painting caves what are they painting and where and why are they doing this okay and I've I I've explained to you there is religious significance to what they're doing they're trying to complete the cycle of life and death if you kill an animal you have to you have to thank the animal okay you do that by making a religious sacrifice okay by sorry by making a religious ritual um what are they painting they're painting the story of life itself right they're trying to paint a picture of how life works a cycle of death and life destruction and renewal and everything's connected together the stars the caves are portals into the spirit world and that's why you celebrate them okay and um how are they painted in the caves um they're painted together and they're using um red ochre and charcoal what's most important is that because these caves actually lack oxygen when they're painting when they're painting these uh paintings it's almost like they're in a trans state okay does that make sense because you don't have enough to um um breathe so it's almost like you're you're you're on the precipice the edge of life and death and it's almost as though you are actually communicating communicating with the spirit world as you're doing this so it's all divine inspiration all divine intuition okay so what they believe is that when they paint they're channeling the power of the spirit world it's not about us using our experience to paint it's we are channeling actually the divine when we do so okay and the same thing when we sing or when we tell stories we're not doing this out of our own will we are we are only a portal or a mechanism or channel for the divine to communicate with everyone else okay so does this make sense okay all right the other thing that's really interesting about these cave paintings is um we find symbols inside these cave paintings so this is Genevie von Piter who is a Canadian archaeologist and she spent decades going to different uh caves in Europe and she cataloged all the different symbols okay so these are not pictures they're symbols and as you can see there's a lot of them okay so why would they have these symbols and also what's interesting is if you think about it this is a writing system in other words they had the capacity to write but they chose not to write why because if you think about it in this world writing is a corruption right when you speak you're channeling the vine so when you are writing something down you're actually counterfeiting the divine okay also remember that for them what's stop talking is really like singing right and you cannot capture music in the written form so it's almost like a corruption of the song okay and and also for them this is really important all everything is meant to be a communal experience when you sing when you talk when you paint we do it together okay but you when you write it's a solitary experience and that's why even though we humans from a very um like right from the beginning we had the capion to write we chose not to write okay this is really important for us to understand writing was a conscious decision it was not something it was not a technology that was invented later on we just chose not to do it because we thought it was a corruption of the natural world okay all right does that make sense okay so this is a um these are all the geometric signs of of ice age Europe it's very similar to alchemy okay alchemy is trying to figure out the secrets of the universe so the question then is where do they get these signs and the answer of course is it came to them in a dream or they were inspired with these signs okay this is a world of inspiration of intuition of imagination it's not something that's deliberate they don't plan this out and discuss it it just comes to them and when they draw it out it makes sense to people oh I know what this means okay all right so uh let's summarize okay why are the symbols in art well because there are certain abstraction certain concepts you cannot draw out right so for example energy is a very important concept life force cycle repetition well then you have to use symbols in order to express uh these ideas if you want to tell the story okay second is you are trying to visualize the language of the spirit world okay so the spirit world is talking to you but they come to you in images so you use the symbols in order to express what what what they're talking about um and when you draw the symbols on a stone you're making the stone divine and sacred right you're storing a memory inside the stone maybe something wonderful happened here maybe you gave birth to a child here right then you commemorate the stone with a symbol okay does that make sense okay so why you're doing this is well first of all you're trying to bring beauty to the world that's that's why we're we humans were created right to make this world a more beautiful place a more imaginative place to celebrate the divine um we're showing God or the spirit world or the underlying soul of reality okay we're trying to figure out how the spirit world works inside our reality the third reason is we're trying to tell a story about who we are okay we're trying to combine our imagination together to create society to create belonging to create community okay okay does that make sense so sorry so you said about human trying to connect with the divine spirits right so do they come okay sorry sorry let me clarify okay this is really important we're not trying to connect with the divine spirit why because divine spirit is all around us we we coexist with the divine okay everything everything around us is divine but what what we're trying to do is we're trying to be in harmony with the divine okay okay do you understand okay because because in this world there's no separation between the material and the spiritual it's all one world together the spiritual is all around us but there are certain things that we do in order to reconcile our existence with the spirit world for example we kill an animal we need to commemorate the animal through paintings and through songs okay does that make sense okay does that answer your question yeah okay good okay all right and we even today we still do this okay so so let's see examples this is graffiti okay street art but you can see what's happening where uh this is Spain and you can see how beautiful this is okay it's the same concept as the K paintings where we're trying to give meaning to our community we're trying to tell story of who we are where we came from and where we're going okay and it's and it's designed to um build a common imagination okay no different from the cape paintings we still do this today and this is another example and you can see different communities might have different focus but you can see how the painting what it does is it unifies the imagination of the people okay so for this community what matters is the family okay so the matriarch the mother is the cornerstone of this community and that's what you do with this painting okay you can see how beautiful these buildings have become because of the paintings so that's what art does art gives purpose meaning to our world all right okay so some really important concepts I need you guys to understand okay and we'll go over this as a semester progresses and these concepts are going to be counterintuitive for us okay but the first concept I want you to understand is preiterate people okay people who could not read and write they were more intuitive they were more imaginative and they were more empathic okay meaning I can know your emotions right away i don't have to ask you anything i don't I don't have to ask you how you're feeling today i know exactly how you're feeling right away okay all right so we can see this this is Inuit art okay so this is art um by native people so even in communities of today that have hold to this tradition you can see how they perceive the world right they perceive the world as unified the gods are with us in fact everything we do is a celebration of the gods so our house is our temple okay the temple is not a place you go and and um celebrate the gods you celebrate the gods in your house if you if you have enough faith to turn your house into a temple okay so this is inward art okay and if you go to like many native communities communities that maintain the traditions of the ice age they're all like this okay in their perception but the problem is they cannot communicate it using modern language so we just think they're stupid okay they can't write essays they can't give speeches and so therefore we we think they're stupid but they're not stupid it's just that they're focusing their energies on empathy on imagination on intuition all right so let's give examples of empathy in action and this is this is true for the entire world okay so once there was a horse in America that could do math all right so the horse would go on stage and then the trainer would ask the horse a question like what's 2 plus two and the horse would be like nay nay nay nay and it would be like oh the horse can do math okay so the horse cannot do math okay i'm telling you right now the horse cannot do math so what the what what the horse is doing you think about it is the horse is reading the room right because the people who pay the money to go into the theater watch the horse do math obviously believe the horse can do math okay so what happens is when the trainer says to the horse "What's 2 plus two?" The horse is nay nay and the horse is watching everyone okay and as the as the horse comes to the answer the horse sees that the peoples are like really excited okay their eyes are bulging their breathing is faster because people are anticip anticipation right the horse is "Oh now I know the answer." Okay this is empathy animals can do it we can do it as well it's actually our super superpower okay does that make sense right second example is telepathy so in America right now there's a very popular pro podcast called the telepathy tapes you might have seen it you may you may have heard of it okay the idea is that kids with autism are able to read the minds of their parents guys I'm telling you right now kids the autistic kids cannot do that they do something else okay so let me tell you a story of how they do this in China there's also a a similar case where a mother in the countryside okay so she's not educated she has no money but her son is autistic it's an autistic boy doesn't really speak can I make eye contact okay lots of issues can I go to school so one day the mother contacts CC CCTV the national broadcaster says "Hey my son can read my mind." And you know these are TV people she like "Okay this will make a good documentary." So they fly all the way down to this village this poor village and the mother is you know doesn't speak great Chinese so they have to film this process okay so what happens is the boy is put into a room by himself and then the mother is given a number okay like maybe five then the mother goes and asks the boy "Please read my mind." And the and the boy says "You saw the number five." And it's pretty amazing and of course it's not really believable so this documentary team spent days and days figure out what happened okay finally brought on they brought in artificial intelligence AI what the AI AI figured out is it's the pitch of the voice that gives the answer okay so now they're saying read my mind read my mind okay and the difference in the pitch there's a different number in that pitch but the problem is it's so subtle that only the boy can hear the difference in pitch we humans ordinary humans cannot hear the difference and so the documentary crew confronted her and says "Listen we the AI artificial intelligence system tells us that what you're doing is you're cheating you are uh using pitch to give signals to your son is that true?" And the mother is like "Yes I'm sorry yes it's all a lie we're poor my son is autistic i want my boy to go to school i want my boy to get professional help." And that's why we devised this scheme in order to trick you so we we can get some television coverage and then maybe we can get some donations maybe some people will help us okay and that's why we did the scheme and so that's it but think about this think how amazing it is that the two together were able to deise a scheme right think of how think of how amazing is that they were a that they were able to devise a scheme that was so creative that it tricked people only an artificial intelligence system could figure the system out okay they so this mother is not educated but she loves her son and she wants the best for her son so she figure out what her son's special ability is pitch she able to hear different sounds and devis a scheme to make full use of the sun's ability okay so that tells us the power of the human imagination if we truly love someone okay so they created a hidden emotional language together which again is amazing and it's it's something that that you will see when two people actually love each other they will create their own language that that only they can understand like in the last example is some cooperative painting right so we discussed this where if I put 10 of you in a room and I give you a blank wall and I ask you to draw the pictures you're going to create are going to pretty be going to be pretty amazing okay you're not allowed to speak you're not allowed to cooperate you're not allowed to plan it ahead but I guarantee you when the two 10 of you get together and you start drawing together you will draw a great picture and the reason why is not because you want to draw a great picture it's because you all want to help each other you don't want to let each other down okay because of cooperation because of empathy you want to be at your very best you want to be at your creative best that's the secret to creativity okay when you're able to find a purpose and meaning in other people your creative potential will be fully released does that make sense okay all right um so back to the horse horse example if you ride a horse one thing that you will learn over time is the horse can read your mind okay and so this is a polo game and if you watch a polo game it's pretty amazing because you're not you can't speak to the horse right but the horse will know exactly instantaneously what you want to do if you want to turn right the horse knows turn right even before you think the thought the horse will know okay and this is why throughout human history warriors on horseback were the greatest warriors they were invincible why because what happened was basically the men had four legs okay because because in these um uh pneumatic societies where people fought on horseback they were born on horses and they were riding horses since they were early or since they were young and so they developed this emotional connection with the horse so the horse knows exactly what you think even before you think it okay and there are lots of examples like this if you have a dog you know that dogs have telepathy right so you go away for a week and then and when you come back the dog is waiting for you at the door then the dog knows you're coming back that's the emotional connection that's telepathy okay so te telepathy exists but it's an emotional connection there's no way that I can actually read your mind but I know how you feel even at long distances okay does that make sense all right um another important fact about human beings that is not really understood is we are obsessed with being creative and expressing ourselves that's who we are okay we are the imagination personified manifested made tangible made visceral okay we are imagination itself our imagination is resilient and will always find a way to shine okay so you may know of people who lose uh sense right so if you can't see your hearing improves or these people are deaf okay so they can't hear but then able to see much stronger okay and they use sign language to communicate and one thing that I've noticed in China is that when I go to restaurants now and then there'll be groups of deaf people communicating with with each other They're always happier in fact they're the happiest people you will ever meet in China and it's not because they're doing sign language it's because deaf people have a deeper emotional intelligence and so when when they're together they're communicate emotionally and that brings tremendous joy and comfort to them okay does that make sense all right let's give another example this is a great composer one of the greatest composers in human history Beethoven his music is startling okay his famous his music is extremely famous problem is he was deaf that's kind of strange how is it possible for you to be deaf at the same time compose some of the world's greatest music the answer is he saw the music okay the music came to him in dreams and was able to see the picture okay because what is music music is vibrations right so but they're like vibrations they're waves right so you can actually see for yourself a movie of vibrations and the more symmetrical these vibrations are the more beautiful the music is does that make sense so because he saw the music he was able to create music that was unique in human history others hear the music but he saw the uh music and it turned into a movie okay of movement all right this is John Milton he wrote Paradise Lost problem is he wrote it while he was blind okay how did he do that because he heard the songs okay he turned Paradise Lost into a musical into music so he actually didn't need to speak it out he just heard it out okay so he had um secretaries who wrote out whatever he sang out and that's why when you read periodiz law it's actually like music it's beautiful one of the most it's probably the most beautiful poetry ever composed in the English language so you can see how resilient the human imagination is if you want to express yourself you'll find a way okay it's all about will do you really want to express yourself because if you do you'll always find a way okay all right so this is another lesson that you will learn the semester we are socialized into mundanity our true selves are divine okay you're normal you're boring you're not talented because you believe what others tell you okay society does not want talent people society does not want interesting people society just wants robots and slaves so schools companies organizations socialize you into mundanity okay into nothingness but if you look at your true self it is divine and I'll give you examples of this um a lot of people have Alzheimer's so what literally happens is they're losing their minds and this is um a self-portrait of a artist who documented himself losing his mind so when he was first diagnosed he drew a picture of himself okay and then a year later he drew another picture of himself and on and on and on as you can see by this time he's completely lost his sense of being okay so you can use this picture as a metaphor for Alzheimer's and and you can see for yourself what it means to lose your mind but there's another way to understand this picture which is what's really happening is that the artist he's shedding his artifice he's shedding his clothing and revealing his true self okay what Alzheimer's is is losing your socialization because you're losing your ability to speak you're losing your ability to verbalize your ideas you're losing your ability to communicate with others and what what's left behind are three things first is your spiritual desires so a lot of people with Alzheimer's for for whatever reason they go to church suddenly okay they're not religious maybe that maybe they they're they grow up in an atheist household they don't have any association with religion but once they develop Alzheimer's they have this spiritual desire to go to church and pray it's really amazing okay that's number one number two is they love to sing okay they don't talk but they sing the third thing is they draw okay this is a painting by a Alzheimer's patient okay not great but guess what guys he did this when he was like eight years old and he never painted before okay that's pretty amazing never painted before but the moment he had Alzheimer's his true divine self opened up and he wanted to express himself okay so what they say about Alzheimer's is you hear voices you see things that aren't there it's a hallucination but guess what guys I told you this during the ice age era we all did this we all believe that we were we co coexisted with ghosts with spirits with fairies okay and this was true throughout most of human history so even though yes medically speaking psychologically speaking these people with Alzheimer's they are hearing voices but then the reason why is the voices were always there we just forgot about it because we're socialized to forget about the different forces the different voices that exist along along us okay this is a person who used psychedelics okay he's like she's an artist but she's using psychedelics and the thing about psychedelics is it's almost similar to um having Alzheimer's where you shed away your socialization you almost enter a spiritual realm okay as you can see this is a picture of a cat what she's doing is she's drawing a cat that's the divine cat okay she's seeing the energy field of the cat she's seeing the memory she's seeing the aspirations she's seeing the intuition the imagination of the cat and embedding it into the artwork this is another person on psychedelics what's interesting is there's no time and space in art in this art so it becomes almost incomprehensible to us okay why is there a helicopter what's a cat okay well that's how we truly are okay we don't have a concept of space and time we see things as they are and and this picture shows you that and we can see how the pictures are it's a heightened reality okay much more vibrant colors okay another psychedelic painting okay as you can see no concept of time and space okay it's all just one unity of things ventang go okay the greatest painter who's ever lived his paintings are utterly unique in human history this is Star Night um and this is Sunflower okay but you can see how he has shed away his socialization he doesn't care what this how this is communicated to other people all it cares is about the picture itself okay so it glows with life all right so let's summarize the concepts that we've learned okay so you've been brainwashed into thinking certain ideas about who we are they're not true the first myth is we humans are driven by material desires okay so why do we want uh so what do we want we want a lot of money okay okay we want to pass on our genes we want to marry a lot of beautiful women who are young and so they can give us a lot of lot of babies because we want to pass on our genes okay and we want to maintain our status all we care about is power okay fundamentally we we we humans are fundamentally imagination and we care about three things the first is we want to express our religion through art music and rituals we want to know where we came from why we're here where we're going okay that's who we really are that's that's the first thing second thing is we are diverse and want to differentiate ourselves okay we want to stand out we want to be different we want we want to be creative the third thing is we are curious and want to explore and that's what explains why we go everywhere okay this has been true throughout human history we may not have documents saying that we were traveling but we were traveling because there's always some of us who want to go and see a new world even though it may not exist that's who we are fundamentally so don't believe people when they say "Okay you just care about money you just care about power you just care about sex." That's not who we are we what we are are fundamentally religious spiritual beings that want to create and to love and to connect okay that's the first myth second myth is the most natural unit is a family and men want to protect their property which includes women so you maybe you've been taught that okay men are in charge and women are just uh animals to breed babies okay that's not true for most of human history it was women who had control of their bodies women could choose who to sleep with and how many men to sleep with and they often chose to sleep with everyone why because sleeping with other men first of all women enjoy it okay but second of all it allows women to create social co cohesion so for most of human history early civilizations women were the core and center of all societies and the third thing is there's actually a strategy in sleeping with many different men because now everyone is responsible for raising a child does that make sense if I if I'm this father and I know exactly who my children are then I'm going to protect my children and and discard everyone else okay but if no one knows who the fathers are everyone responsible for caring for for taking care of every single child and that's the best strategy that they can have okay because that ensures that every child becomes um successful okay does that make sense okay so the second myth that we will discuss later on third myth humans follow the iron rule of nature survival of the fittest okay that's that's taught by Darwin that's what evolution is but that's wrong okay throughout most of human history humans cared for each other we were compassionate empathy right we believe that every cre creature has divinity and those who are weakest have the most divinity that's why when we kill an animal we still thank the animal because we're all part of the same life cycle all right number four humans have gotten smarter over the centuries civilization is far superior to primitive cultures again this is wrong okay the truth is that with the development of civilization the human imagination has decreased our brains can be supercomputers if we allow them to be but if people are more creative which means they have they have better memories than we do okay they're able to recall more stuff they're able to store more information they're more sensitive more sensitive perception they have more empathy okay they know exactly how you're feeling why you're feeling it and how to make you feel better and uh greater emotional resilience okay so they're much more mature than we are number five we evolve from apes the truth is that we are uniquely imaginative and we can choose our own evolution don't believe we're apes okay if you believe you're an ape then you're an ape okay if you're an ape then you like to go beat people up and like have sex with with like a lot of women okay but we're not apes we're imaginative first and foremost and as such we have control over our lives and something that you have to like learn for yourself all right so let me give an example of this to conclude the class um this is Roma 2 and we discovered him 10,000 years ago um in a bureau site okay this is an ice age bureau site he's a dwarf guys okay he's a dwarf you can see how small he is he's a dwarf and you would think that dwarfs don't really contribute to the community so maybe you know he's born it's clear he's he's um uh deformed so just kill the guy okay because he's not going to have a great life anyway instead what we found is first of all he lived to a pretty old age and he was buried with um jewelry he was buried elaborately and you only do that for people you really prize that's kind of strange right the people who we think that are most worthless dwarfs that actually don't do anything they actually thought was divine and deserved a extremely elaborate ritualized funeral why okay so this is a book um that done everything by David Grabber and David Wangro great book okay so what they say is this when archaeologists undertake balance appraisals of huntergather burials from the p paleothic they find high frequencies of health related disabilities but also surprising high levels of care until the time of death and beyond since some of these funerals were remarkably lavish this is an amazing idea to think about but if you were deformed if you were ill they didn't throw you out they spent a lot of time to take care of you even though from their perspective it was a waste of time and energy because you're going to die anyway so why would they why would they do that well there are three possibilities okay the first possibility is it's really about maintaining cosmic balance and harmony effing is a cycle meaning what meaning we're all part of God and if you suffer then we have to make you better because we're all part of God together okay so the concepts are unity of all as above so below set a good example to others okay so that's the first possibility second possibility is because this is a pre-iterate society people have a stronger sense of empathy and morality so they didn't want to see others suffer okay and the third possibility is they appreciate diversity and difference in a way we don't anymore okay our entire school system is designed as survive the fittest if you can't do math goodbye you're worthless if you can't get 100 on on a test goodbye you're worthless okay but back then they saw difference and diversity as gifts from God right so if you're a dwarf it meant you had something special to offer if you're strong yeah you can go hunt animals and you can protect the the family but if you're a dwarf it meant that you might have something else to offer and if we just celebrate you as someone who has something special to offer then you can offer it to us okay and often what they could do is well they could probably seen better they could probably tell better stories they had more wisdom they were have more intuition the connection with the divine okay that's true even today where the best storytellers the best musicians often those who are marginalized from society those who are strangers who are those who are outsiders those who society persecutes they probably have greater imagination greater intuition greater empathy and today we don't celebrate these things but back then they did celebrate those things so if you are different if you're deformed if you were ill they saw you as blessed rather than cursed and that's what we've forgotten today okay all right so that's it this is just introduction into the entirety of human history okay we're going to go pretty fast any questions so would you say that because you made the examples using um let's you said Alzheimer's um autistic people so would you say that people with um cognitive disability in like modern age are like closer to the divine where like we're returning to the divine by uh abandoning our cognitive so-called like um you know the like um logic and everything that the civilization is would you say that makes us closer would bring us closer to the divine yeah good question okay yeah so um first of all we're all connected to the vine but we just choose to forget we're connected to the vine okay why because society mass society needs you to be obedient needs you to be a machine needs you to work to be obedient okay so so the entire point of school is to separate you from the divine why because at an early age you're removed from your parents okay and in school you're taught all sorts of like really strange knowledge like 1 plus 1 equals 2 like what who cares 1 plus 1 equals two okay but you're taught this is what matters um and before we would just let kids run around nature and learn resilience learn courage learn creativity okay so the entire point of society is to brainwash you or remove you from the divine but there's certain members of society who can't be um removed from the vine because we don't want them right so kids who are autistic uh kids with disabilities kids who are just different okay once you discard it they actually return to the vine does that make sense yeah so is like for example a lot of people develop cognitive disabilities after a lot of um like you said being put into schools um being uh kind of um limited by the civilization would you say that in that circumstance by developing or be given a cognitive disability we're actually reconnecting with the divine okay yeah okay so let's clarify okay so in China in United States everywhere in the world we're seeing a massive surge in mental illnesses right so depression eating disorders um suicidal tendencies um anxiety anxiety fear okay so so I mean like it's just an explosion these past 20 years especially with the uh advent of mobile phones social media the internet okay so kids lives suck okay so why are kids so miserable and the answer is that when you're born you have an automatic connection with the vine okay so and as you lose this connection you grow more and more confused which lead leads to anxiety and doubt and over time if this confusion is not addressed properly then it will lead to depression okay so another simple way of saying another simple way of saying this is we we crave human connection we crave um knowledge of the divine we crave purpose and meaning in our lives but the social media system has created this fake system in which we're in prison our imagination is imprisoned in pursuing activities that absolutely have no purpose right so on social media all you care about is likes how do I get my friends to like me like me like me okay so you do a sort of silly things like I don't know post pictures of you dancing in Hawaii or whatever even though it g it gives you no meaning okay so what's happening is before we cared about what makes us happy and now we care about what we think would make other people happy okay and that's not who we are okay once you lose that connection to the vine then you you can only get lost so if you deny your intuition if you d if you deny your emotions then you'll just become more and more miserable okay does that make sense okay uh like the strong empathy that you just mentioned I thought that I'm curious where the strong empathy come from because I usually thought that the empathy is our empathy is shaped by the socialization and social norms by the society yeah actually that's a really good question okay so empathy just means our connections with others okay and this something we are born with so a mother is born with a emotional connection with a child right and a child has has emotional connection with a mother and over time as this connection grows their empathy develops and this empathy almost becomes telepathic so that even if the child is is in school and the child is bullied the mother is doing is washing her clothes she's like you know I don't feel right maybe I should call the teacher and ask how my child is doing okay okay so that's what empathy is empathy just means a natural emotional connection that we're all born with but it's entirely possible um and we know this from our society to break that connection by setting the child off to school by having a child online too much by having a child watch television too much okay severing breaking that emotional connection and once the emotional connection is broken remember empathy we crave empathy we crave emotions more than we crave food so it's as though we're becoming zombies almost right if you don't have empathy you don't feel connected with other people it's as though you become a zombie you don't you don't have any you don't have any direction you don't have any purpose you don't have any meaning in life anymore and that's what leads to tremendous depression okay does that make sense so we are not socialized into empathy we are socialized out of empathy we're born into empathy okay all right great questions okay any more questions okay great guys so I will see you next time all right we'll continue this next time okay so I'm just introducing these concepts but we'll expand them and use more examples and learn more about human history from this framework all right okay thank you thank you
