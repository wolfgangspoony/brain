Toot is a girl from texas i met on fetlife. we didnt meet for sexual or romantic reasons its kind of chaos magic, i specifically felt a call to reach out beyond phsyical plane so i used graphic design skills to make an emo vampiric eboy looking guy holding a little purple haired round headed elf girl like in a caring embrace like giving real "rough emo boy looks out for bpd type girlie"

toot picked up on that energy and we besties now, goofy relationship style but we people from trauma and weirdness so whatever its how it goes yknow
