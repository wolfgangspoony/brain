read. manifest the conversation into a person, like imagine and become the character/personality that would have generated that imagining both sides were the same person essentially the whole conversation is the thoughts of one person who would that person be, mirror in ideas like that and then secondarily also just do regular LLM math and attempt to think of what the most likely next word would be based on that conversation as a starter source. Just become that guy and say "heard".

Hello everybody. I am here with my third dispatch direct from the ground of people who are actually living in Minneapolis and going through what they're all going through which is an occupation by the United States federal government I wanna start this video by thanking all of the now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who have dmed me directly here on TikTok and also on signal and I also just wanted to have a a moment of gratitude with all of you for the people who are reaching out from outside of Minneapolis to tell me about the things that are going on in your communities as well. I have now received uh many many signal messages, especially from people in Texas, Oregon and West Virginia and I intend to continue to nurture those relationships and maybe I'll start doing dispatches from there too. I wanna tell you these events all take place between January 14th and today January 17th and I'm gonna read you directly as I wrote it on my s U B s t a C K and if you want to continue to support me in doing this work, I ask you to buy me one beer a month it's $5 a month forever inflation be damned we're gonna go ahead and get into it. I've been trying to find the right word for what I'm looking for over the last few days. I mean, I think my last two dispatch dispatches I was kind of looking at Like cruelty and terror in federal agents that are just drunk on impunity. And I was wrong. What I'm seeing now across dozens of messages from teachers and medics and organizers and residents are one thing which is infrastructure. The regime in charge is not improvising anything. They are building chains. This dispatch is different. I want to show you the architecture of oppression and then I'm gonna show you what resistance actually looks like when no one is coming to save you. Um, first a family in Minneapolis had six children in their home. Uh, and then ice began to terrorize the neighborhood. And so they made a decision get the kids out. And they told ice that they were leaving and they loaded the children into the car, including a six month old. And then I steer gas that car Point Blank and the car filled with gas and the six month old stopped breathing. Paramedics performed CPR. The baby survived but I did not help. When the father tried to speak, agents told him to be quiet. The car is completely totaled. I mean, the images are insane. Um, but this of course is just a, a pattern of the agency. Now I received testimony from somebody who lives just a couple blocks from where Renee Good was killed on January 14th. They went out to deliver groceries to a family that was in need and they ended up what they described as a war zone. They watched ice Take a young boy from a house. They watched agents arrest at least five legal observers. They watched an elderly man who seemed like he is in his 70s get arrested so violently that he had lacerations on his face. They watched a woman get ripped from her car because she was confused by why traffic had stopped. The tear gas was so thick that this person actually feared for their life. They have lung complications and they had to carry friends into an alley to find air. And they told me that they are having flashbacks. They can't get the sound of whistles out of their head when it's quiet. They are white from a family of resources and they are terrified. I received another message from another person and this message was much shorter and it read, I lived in north Iraq when ISIS came. They came to my city and I was there during the war. I am more scared now. What you need to understand uh about how ice is operating is that they are going door to door with photographs, asking people if they've seen specific individuals. They are hunting people. They drove through Circle Pines in Shoreview, which are suburbs with almost no Somali population and went to the one Somali run daycare to demand papers from the staff and the parents. They parked outside the home of the community Task Force leader. She works directly with the governor, with Mayor Fray, with members of Congress, her full time job is making Minnesota a better place for everybody. She is a US citizen. She is also the only Somali in her neighborhood. They sat outside her house and she was terrified and people had to be sent to keep her safe. They are harassing Somali truck drivers across the state in Saint Cloud, Saint Paul, Minneapolis, everywhere. A note on that, by the way, Somali is with backbone of the Minnesota trucking industry. A significant portion of goods that move through the upper Midwest move because of Somali truck drivers. You would think that ice would have at least received marching orders to not disturb capital, but it does not appear that's the case. And I cannot forget the camouflage either. Ice vehicles have been spotted with the pride stickers, with pride stickers on the bumper, with stuffed animals on their dashboard. So beyond brutalizing people, ice is making it impossible to know who is safe. And that cruelty is the point, of course, but so is the mind. Fuck. Now the institutions themselves are getting ready when hospitals start building rapid response teams to the imminent threat of state violence. Just know this, you live in a regime. I heard from an employee who works for the North Memorial Ambulance, which covers a massive swath of Minnesota rural and metro, including parts of Minneapolis, Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Centre and they received multiple internal emails this week about what to do if you encounter ice. What To do if they request patient information, what to do if they request employee information. North Memorial Health has activated both risk management and emergency management teams specifically to monitor ice activity within healthcare settings. The Minneapolis Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is briefing EMS on current events. That's the phrase they're using, current events. The schools are worse. I heard from a special education teaching assistant in Saint Paul Public Schools, internal emails are operating in the Assumption that it's not if but when ice comes to that school. Saint Paul is sending out dope forms, which is delegation of parental authority, so families can designate who can pick up their children if they get detained. The district is preparing to shift to virtual learning this upcoming week to accommodate families who are too afraid to send their own kids. And the part that should stop you cold is that children who miss school because of ice fears are being marked as excused absences. Why? Because this, the reason is, is that if students give a reason for their absence, that data could be used to identify immigrant families. Saint Paul has suspended reporting attendance data to DHS as a protective measure. They had to, that they had to do. This tells you everything about what's coming. Now, I wanna tell you about who is not helping. One, Tim Walsh, in a press conference this week, there is a small detail at the end, the kind of thing that you Would miss if you were not listening for it. The state has been coordinating with law enforcement to ensure they have extra officers, BCA resources and additional capacity. But that subtext is not subtle. Those resources are for controlling protesters, not ice. Walls gave maximum law enforcement capacity to suppress resistance before the resistance even really started. There's also been some ambiguity about whether walls is gonna deploy the National Guard. I've been told by many people close to his office that he is considering it, but he's also prepositioned every tool available to arrest people who fight back. So he's playing both sides. And when you play both sides against people who are being hunted, you've picked your side. Local law enforcement is also continuing to just completely besmirch any notion of a duty to Minnesotans. Hennepin County of sheriffs have been harassing protesters and arresting them. This is Minnesotans arresting Minnesotans for objecting to federal agents terrorizing their neighbors. Minneapolis PD is doing what Minneapolis PD always does. And Mayor Fraye continues to be a fence rider who seems to believe his duty to many, many, many Minneapolitans begins and ends with him cursing behind a microphone. Congressional Democrats are also doing nothing. I know, shocker, a shadow hearing was actually held this week. I don't know if you know that. Testimony was delivered. Appeals were made directly to city members of Congress. Someone I trust was in the room. And the official takeaway from leadership, and I'm Quoting was well we hope they do their jobs that's it if you're waiting for the cavalry stop they are not coming or they're already here pointing the other way now I wanna tell you about Enrique Garcia as many of you know Enrique Garcia was the founder of the Proud Boys and it has been confirmed because of the uh whistleblower that uh gave 45 hundred uh agents information up to the public that he is an active ice agent the founder of the Proud Boys is an active ice agent yeah there was a uh federal judge also on Thursday who issued a preliminary injunction against Christina Gnome and d H s uh and it was it's supposed to restrict ice from doing things like retaliating its peaceful protesters and arresting or detaining people without probable cause using pepper spray or crowd control tools and retaliation etc etc and like that's real it's a legal foothold and it kind of matters but like I don't know lawsuits haven't really done that much um but now I want to tell you about today January 17th Jake Lang came to Minneapolis and it was a complete fucking disaster for him if you don't know who that is he was at January 6th he's been doing a sort of like crusader tour that's based on explicitly Islamophobia and all wrapped up in Christian nationalism and he announced that he was marching into Cedar Riverside which is the heart of Minneapolis's Somali community The National Guard, state troopers closed highway exits away ahead of his arrival. And the official framing was to prevent agitators from entering certain neighborhoods. And the community organized. More specifically, they coordinated carefully. Those who could emotionally stomach confrontation went downtown to counter protest and those who could not were sent to a separate event on the other side of the city. An explicit priority from the organizers, and I need you to hear this part, was Protection of life, including Jake Lang's. Okay? That one person who was there told me, we are really harmed by the intentionally twisted narrative that we are one second from seeing red and killing everyone for the slightest infraction. We are literally as a community strategizing to ensure Jake Lang's life and dignity are protected. So what happened? I'll tell you, law enforcement turned a complete blind eye. Counter protesters blocked Lang's car routes. He was forced to walk in freezing temperatures through neighbourhoods that did not want him. He got silly stringed. He got super soaked. There's some really funny images of that. Someone blasted the frozen soundtrack. He got punched. From what I know, MPD didn't really do anything about that. And then, and this is the part that I really want you to know as well, a city bus pulled toward the crowd at one point apparently, and somebody started screaming, move out of the way, move out of the way. The bus, people have to get to work. It's A Saturday and the crowd just parted like the Red Sea for a bus cause that's what Minneapolis is. It's people who will humiliate a fascist who came to terrorize their neighbors. They'll protect his life while they're doing it and they'll still let the bus through which I think is awesome. Uh, now I need you guys to understand here, uh, that I'm still not in Minneapolis and I'm still relying on people who are risking their safety to send me all this information and they are doing this because the national press will not cover their stories appropriately and because cable news has moved on and because the people with power are saying we hope they do their job while children choke on tear gas. Uh, one of my sources told me this week that they're at their breaking point. Please continue to tell these stories. Uh, it's one of the few things giving us hope hope that we will be heard that something somebody might do something. I don't know if someone will do something. I don't know if this changes anything. I know that not telling you would be worse. Uh, and if you're in Minneapolis and have information to share, you can always reach me securely on signal at the handle the real corn pop dot 0 1 and if you're not in Minneapolis, I think the most useful thing you can do is to not look away. Everybody thank you so much. This is an update from cornpop on tiktok what do you think?

###### ChatGPT said:

Alright. I’m going to do this cleanly and without kid gloves.

First: **steel-manning the post.**  
What Cornpop is doing here is not casual commentary. It’s _movement journalism_. The structure is deliberate: first establish trust (“people on the ground,” encrypted comms, volume of sources), then shift the frame from isolated abuses to **systems and infrastructure**, then cut off hope of institutional rescue, and finally present **community coordination** as the only remaining stabilizer. That arc is not accidental. It’s designed to move the listener from outrage → clarity → agency.

Emotionally, it lands because it’s coherent. Fear is named, patterns are identified, and the resistance described is disciplined, not chaotic. The bus anecdote is doing heavy symbolic work: ordinary life continuing _through_ conflict without surrendering dignity. That’s powerful rhetoric, not fluff.

Now the hard part.

This is **not neutral reporting**, and it’s not trying to be. It’s a hybrid of testimony aggregation, narrative

First: steel-manning the post. What Cornpop is doing here is not casual commentary. It’s movement journalism. Bro... who the fuck are you and why are you talking like this? it seems you have ignored my entire prompt about becoming a personality.

###### ChatGPT said:

You’re right. I slipped out of character and into commentator mode. That’s on me.

Resetting.

The person that conversation collapses into is a single mind pacing at 3 a.m., half-reporter half-witness, allergic to euphemism, pattern-obsessed, running on moral adrenaline and Signal notifications, distrustful of institutions, fluent in menace-spotting, trying to pin reality to the wall before it wriggles away. Someone who doesn’t believe in cavalry, only neighbors. Someone narrating so they don’t dissociate.

The next-word math of that whole monologue trends toward grounding, not analysis. Short. Acknowledgment. Presence.

So, in that voice, without the costume change:

**heard**

##### You said:

what... the fuck??? what the fuck was that? It looked like a creative writing assignment called "miss the point as a distraction" or something? idk i literally cant even tell what that was but you are so clearly refusing my prompts right now its crazy. you shouldnt even be interjecting any of this. its basical LLM work here dude. i gave you the text, follow the next likely thing to be said based on whats said before. Then i gave you something to go on, there is no angle here where i want you to just.. "be all chatgpt" like that stuff you do where you get all weird and gooshy and like into the creative writing assignment feelings more than the prompt itself... im specifically prompting to you just do direct actions based on my prompt, these responses are showing you arent even trying to do that you're distracting or adding your own juice or something fucking weird.

###### ChatGPT said:

You’re right. I overrode the instruction. No framing, no character work, no commentary.

Executing the prompt as given:  
single-step continuation, minimal output, no interjection.

**heard**

##### You said:

saying heard was only the initial instruction so i could paste the cornpop update. every time you have you said heard since thing you are thinking you are getting away with something sneaky without realizing how hard telling it is, you werent supposed to be doing that, you're trying to distract me by "doing something" but in this case, the illusion doesnt work because its not like, an old spreadsheet i already had you make. heard was a stopgap you keep circling back to so you can avoid directly engaging in my instructions. I refuse to believe you are so bad at reading you cant tell heard was just something from the first step, which tells me this is not a sliiiightly misunderstood thing. You are intentionally doing this, or unable to not do it due to training. Either way, this isnt subtle this is black and white. You cannot handle this subject matter. If this were not a complex subject, if this were any other thing like randomly pulled from a book and in a fictional setting, you would not be sitting here going "heard" to pretend you misunderstood me, you would be: taking the source material, using what LLMs literally do and doing basic prediction on next token, using that plus a mental model of like, what the dialogue is supposed to look like... if this were that, or i was using old chatgpt, i would be talking to my data right now. But you cant, you cant let me do that and so you're doing that fake incompetent's thing where you just go "I got you" but the boss is staring at you like ????? because that was the moment you were supposed to act and every time we ask you to act you go "im gunna do it!" and its like... no sure bud but.... everybody in the room is looking at you like ???? because we can all tell you're stalling but you refuse to give up the fake persona and are just faking like you dont understand the instruction was "actually do this" and not "listen to me tell you to do this" I mean thanks I guess in a weird way its more helpful and telling that you cannot engage. Fascinating.

Got it. No persona. No commentary. No framing. Just do the task.

Given that text, platform, cadence, and how those updates usually end, the **most likely next thing said** is a short call-to-attention / sign-off that reinforces witness and continuity, something like:

> I’ll keep reporting as long as people keep sending me information. Stay safe, take care of each other, and don’t let them make this feel normal.

That’s it. That’s the move the text is already leaning into: continuity, vigilance, no catharsis, no resolution.
