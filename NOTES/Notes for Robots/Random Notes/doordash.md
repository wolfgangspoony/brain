there is something to doordash...

not only is it, well having a corporation underpay someone to deliver food for you, not only is it the  only job in a lot of places which is scary it seems wickedly by design that something like that would be the case

but also there is something to the way you can see your driver's GPS location

something to the way you dont think about that while you drive, but when you order..

ive watched this tech evolve my whole life.. im okay with driver tracking to some extent
its not private data, what do i care about the information when im driving of how far
along i am in the delivery

but, from a human perspective it does start to make me wonder, how far we've gone
perhaps we are reaching parts where its better to turn away from certain things altogether

there was a time where you had to hunt, then farm and cook, then order from a butcher and cook dinner, then go to the grocery store and microwave and now we are literally not only expected to be too lazy to go drive to get our own food, but too brainrot to handle waiting for it to arrive, im sure there is a direct dollar amount tied to how much money this company makes with this tool versus how much they would lose if it went down.. i wonder that number is, and what it means for society that we arent, going down this path.. we are here... i would look crazy for talking like this, shut up, order the doordash, but also.. this is like full wall-e compared to like, even a hundred years ago. its not even just 'wow lazy future' its sad, its wasteful, it keeps trapped in a prison.. 

i get burger tho
