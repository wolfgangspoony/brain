I cannot imagine being an ICE officer and choosing to still go door to door to people's houses when like the nastiest angle trend is going on TikTok and on Instagram for that matter. Like if you don't know what that trend is, it's a trend where people show you exactly where they would post up if they saw the trend started with ATF as like the agency like kind of as a call back to I think like Waco or Ruby Ridge. Um, but now it's being done about ICE and it's people showing spots in their house where they can absolutely hide their full body and the barrel of a gun and they're showing you like if you were to walk in this entryway, I would be able to see you full sight and I'd be able to take you out. And it's the captions of these videos are are not vague. They're like I saw one where a guy was like, I could easily get two or three before they get me. Like that's the energy, man, that like that your workplace has created is is where people are willingly posting videos of themselves on the internet being like, "Yeah, if you come to my house, I'm going to kill you." And like the hiding spots are good. The hiding spots are good. Like some of these hiding spots when the video starts and panning around, I'm like, "Where where is the shooter? I have no idea." And then the the light flashes and I'm like, "Oh, I'd be dead. I I'd be dead for certain"
