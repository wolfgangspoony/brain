Minneapolis is a test because right now in the United States, they're watching something that most Americans have only ever seen happen on television and in other countries. Federal forces moving into a city like its enemy territory. Local authority being treated like an obstacle. and the president keeping troops on standby like he's preparing for domestic deployment. That in America isn't regular politics. Trump is stress testing the system. And if they can make it work in Minnesota, they can make it work anywhere in the United States. Hey, I'm Jason. This is wrong enough to know better. In this episode, I'm going to walk through something that's a little hard to say without sounding like a bit of a conspiracy nut. And I'm not going to pretend that I can read minds. And I'm also going to try and stick to actions, patterns, and incentives. But sometimes there's a fine line between commentary and conspiracy. And I'm really hoping that in retrospect, in history, that this has been commentary, not conspiracy. Trump has been escalating things in Minneapolis. He has 1500 military personnel on standby. And if he deploys them, it won't be about politics. It will be a test. A test of whether the military will obey. and he claims that he has the legal precedent with the Insurrection Act, but he doesn't even have to use the tool for the threat to matter. He just has to claim that he's willing to use it. That's how this test works. Trump gets to see who falls in line, who resists, and who hesitates. Steven Miller says that local police should stand down and let federal forces control the city. So ICE isn't there to support. Miller wants them there to control. And then you've got federal forces outnumbering local police 5 to one. That isn't a joint operation. That's a takeover. If all they wanted was to crack down on illegal immigration, there was an easy way to do that. Go into a deep red state where the governor, the cops, and the voters are already on your side. They'd roll out the red carpet for you. You'd get compliance. You'd get results. And you wouldn't turn a city into a war zone. But that's not what they chose. They chose a blue city in a blue state and a situation guaranteed to create confrontation. So no, illegal immigrants aren't the goal here. Confrontation was always the goal. It doesn't stop with local law enforcement. Trump's Department of Justice is trying to criminalize and discredit the mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota. This is the federal government trying to decide who gets to have power. And it isn't the opposition. And if you don't comply, they won't just pressure you. They'll try to destroy your legitimacy. They'll slap you with criminal charges and they'll paint you as corrupt and then when the feds show up, they can just claim that they're there to restore order. If Biden had done any of this [ __ ] if Biden had gone into Oklahoma or Texas or Florida and tried pulling this stunt, every cousin [ __ ] Timothy McVey would be out there blowing [ __ ] up. And that's not me promoting violence. That's me saying the reaction would have been exponentially worse because right-wing Americans have been trained to treat federal force as tyranny. But of course, only when it happens to them. Minnesota isn't the only escalation. Trump is aggressively pushing the idea of taking Greenland by any means necessary. [clears throat] And until recently, people treated it like it was a joke. It's not because Greenland ties into Denmark and Denmark ties into NATO. If you start a fight there, you aren't just grabbing land, you're lighting a fuse that can absolutely spiral into World War II. And Trump isn't just poking Greenland, which is the entire European Union by default. He's eyeballing Canada and Venezuela, too. He posted a meme on True Social the other day that had the US, Greenland, and Canada wrapped in an American flag. It sends one clear message. The United States is planning for pressure, instability, and conflict. And that's why I said it earlier. Trump isn't testing loyalty. He's testing obedience. Because loyalty is support, but obedience is do what I say when I say it, even if it's wrong, even if it's illegal, and even if it violates your oath. You don't reshape a country with loyal fans. You reshape it with obedient institutions like the police, the Department of Justice, and military command. So, now we get to the motive of all this because Trump might be in his final year as president. Not because his term is ending, but because the midterms could destroy him. If the Republicans lose badly, he's done. Not politically damaged, done. After a bad midterm, at best, he'll be boxed in. There'll be a hostile Congress. There'll be investigations galore. And impeachment could actually be on the table. And here's the key point. A guy like Trump, a dictator wannabe, can only take control before an election, not after. after an election, if the outcome goes against him, he can't just become a dictator out of thin air. So, if there's going to be a power grab, it has to happen soon. And it's not just Trump the clock is running out for. The clock is also running out for the entire 2025 Project 2025 crowd, too. They don't just need Trump in office. They need Trump in control. And if the midterms go bad, their window closes, too. In order for this plan to work, people need to stop thinking myopically. I'm not just talking about unrest. I'm talking about an actual civil war or an actual World War III because that's the scale required for the next moves to work. If you want emergency powers, you need an emergency that people won't just accept. You need an emergency that people will get behind with historic level chaos. So maybe they're playing it from both angles. Maybe it's World War III. Maybe it's a Civil War. Either way, they don't care which one it is as long as one of them works. Straight up cancelling the election probably won't work. But controlling elections, that's different. If it's World War II, Trump can say outside influences are trying to manipulate the vote with foreign interference, sabotage, or cyber threats. And that's when you get security, more federal presence at polling stations, more enforcement, more intimidation dressed up as protection. And if it's civil war, then federal forces are already on the streets. There'd be curfews, checkpoints, armed patrols. Voting would become conditional, not illegal, not cancelled, just controlled. They can't rig the ballot box, but they can [snorts] rig the environment that people are expected to vote in. And there's one more tiny piece. Chaos is very profitable if you're the one controlling it. I don't think that's the main goal, but it's a monster sized bonus. Because when you know the chaos is coming, you can position yourself and your friends to make fortunes. Anyway, I'll say it again. Minneapolis is the test. It's a test of whether federal force can replace local force. It's a test of whether opposition leadership can be discredited and criminalized. And most importantly, it's a test of obedience because if it works in Minnesota, you can rest assured it's coming for the rest of the country soon. Anyway, a couple of quick closing notes.
