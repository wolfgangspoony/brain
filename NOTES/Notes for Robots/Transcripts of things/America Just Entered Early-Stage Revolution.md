Before we talk about what happened in Minneapolis, you need to understand who Jake Lang is. Jake isn't some random guy who wandered into a protest. He's one of those pardon January 6 riers who's turned his whole life into politics as violence. He's a professional agitator. A guy who goes looking for conflict, then cries when he doesn't come out the victor. He isn't just a proTrump guy. He's part of that same racist white grievance movement that's been building over the last decade. The whole mindset where America belongs to one kind of person and everyone else is a problem. That's the world that he lives in. Anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, targets communities like the Somali Americans and acts like they're the invaders, like they don't belong. And guess what? He's running for office. the US Senate in Florida as a Republican. A guy with those views thinks he can end up in the Senate not as an independent crackpot, but as a Republican candidate. 10 years ago, this guy would have been a disgrace. Now, he thinks he's the future of America. So now you know who he is. So here's what he did. Minneapolis has reached a breaking point because ICE has been acting like an occupying military force. There's been protests. There's been violence. Tension is boiling over. And into that mess, this clown Jake shows up. He didn't go to Minneapolis to help. He's not there to listen. He showed up to rub it in people's faces. He showed up hoping that he can do what the right has been doing for the last decade. Walk in aggressively, make people uncomfortable, and act like he's in charge. But it didn't work this time. He showed up with a handful of supporters and he was met with a whole lot more people who were done with his brand of He got physically opposed. He got chased. He got hit. And then he runs online and does what these guys always do when they lose. Victim cosplay. He claims he got stabbed. Yeah, right. You weren't stabbed. You got embarrassed in public. And now you need a story that fits your hero narrative. Hey, I'm Jason. This is wrong enough to know better. If you watched my last video, you know I asked the question, is revolution coming? This video isn't about whether it's coming. This video is about what revolution looks like in the early stages before people realize that it's actually happening because it starts with a shift in public behavior. It starts when people like Jake who used to run their mouths off in public can't do it safely anymore. and the people who were forced to accept his bigotry and racism stop accepting it and start using force. That's the story here. To understand why Minneapolis matters so much, you have to understand what it looked like just a few years ago. So, let's go back to Charlotteville, North Carolina. That was when the racist, bigoted right-wing was at the peak of their confidence. White supremacists marching in public with torches, shields, helmets, weapons. They weren't hiding. They weren't ashamed. They wanted the country to see them because their goal wasn't persuasion. It was intimidation. The message was simple. This is our country. You're going to shut up. And for a while, a lot of Americans did shut up. Not because they agreed, but because it felt like those racists weren't just being tolerated. They were being supported and protected. protected by the culture, protected by the cops, and protected by the politicians. Charlotteville was the moment the radical right tested just how much power they could could exert on the streets. And for a while, they had a lot of power. Now, let's look at Minneapolis. Jake Lang showed up expecting the Charlotteville world. He expected fear. He expected people to stay passive. He expected to own the street just because of his own self sense of grandiose. And instead he got resistance. Not online resistance, real resistance. People physically said no. And this is the point of this video. This isn't just the right losing power. This is the left taking it away from them. Because intimidation only works if people back down. When people stop backing down, the bully doesn't look powerful anymore. He looks weak. He looks pathetic. He looks outnumbered. and then his whole act falls apart. And here's another huge change. Trump support in the real world is way less visible now. If you go back to 2017, 2018, 2019, there were flags on every second truck, hats everywhere, signs everywhere. People wore it like a uniform. Now, it's no secret people are less willing to publicly support Trump's fascist agenda. I'm not saying any of them changed their minds. A lot of them didn't. They just learned that being seen supporting fascism has consequences. When something is popular, people advertise it. When something gets toxic, people hide it. So, they didn't stop believing it. They just stopped putting it all over their trucks. If you only look at the comment sections, you would think that Trump supporters run the country because they never shut up. They talk like they're 90% of America. But the internet isn't real life. The internet is where you go when your point of view doesn't hold up in the real world. online, they act like warriors. In real life, half of them wouldn't say any of it to somebody's face because in real life, there's risk. And Minneapolis just showed that when the confrontation becomes real and the act falls apart, then they go straight into victim cosplay. So when I say revolution, I'm not talking about a theoretical. Revolutions start when the fear of violence is no longer a deterrent. It starts when regular people decide that the bullies don't get to push people around anymore. It starts when people stop saying someone should do something and they start doing it themselves. That's what's happening in Minneapolis. Jake Lang showed up because he thought the intimidation era was still alive and Minneapolis made it clear that era is dead and gone. Don't romanticize this too much. People are scared. People are getting hurt. People are getting dragged away by masked men in militarized costumes and people are getting killed. Trump knows he's losing control and that's making him crack down even harder. So, while it might feel like it's a time for celebration in the resistance movement, it's more a time for cautious optimism because for the last decade, the rightwing has been using intimidation as politics. And Minneapolis is showing that intimidation just isn't working the way that it used to. And that is a serious shift in the country. Americans used to say, "Remember the Alamo." Maybe one day the lesson is going to be, "Remember Minneapolis." Not necessarily because it was some heroic battle, but because it might be the moment the right learned they don't have control anymore. Maybe this is the beginning of something huge. But I'm going to be honest. I'm not holding my breath because my faith in Americans says this. In a couple of weeks, most of them will be back on the couch yelling at their televisions like that was some form of activism. So if this resistance is going to be real, it has to become national and it has to become habitual. Anyway, oh yeah, hit the subscribe button. We're catching up to Mr. Beast.
