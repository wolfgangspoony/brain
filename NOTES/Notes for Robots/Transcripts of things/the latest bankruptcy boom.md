2025 just finished off the year with the highest number of large corporate bankruptcies ever outside of an official recession. Standard and pores tracked 785 total bankruptcy filings from what they classified as significant businesses. A similar data set from the analytics firm Cornerstone Research noted that 32 of these filings were what they had previously hyperbolically dubbed mega bankruptcies, which just meant the firms going under had more than a billion dollars in reported assets. But that doesn't sound as cool. The trend is clear outside of these large companies as well with regular businesses and personal bankruptcies up significantly over 2024, which itself wasn't a great year either. Now, with all of the uh excitement in the economy right now, maybe this isn't exactly shocking to you, especially since most of the bigname failures pretty clearly had it coming. Nickelo motors, Forever 21, and Hooters, as well as the pharmacy Raid, which actually went bankrupt for a second time in 2025, just eight months after exiting its first bankruptcy. Now, that alone should give you a hint that there is a little bit more behind the bankruptcy boom. The trend of high-profile businesses closing their doors on paper certainly spiked last year, but it has been growing for a long time before problems like tariffs provided these businesses with a convenient excuse. So, while it might be fun to point and laugh at the spectacular failures of these high-profile companies that have clearly been incredibly greedy and or run terribly, the brunt of this problem is, as always, impacting regular people and taking place in an industry you might notice. All for reasons you might not expect. >> Hooters of America filing for bankruptcy. That move coming to enable a founder buyout of a casual dining chain. >> Nicola Motors, headquartered in Coolage, filed for bankruptcy. I am 22 years old and I am in $91,300 worth of debt and I am filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy today. >> I filed for bankruptcy when I was 20 years old. >> I filed for bankruptcy. >> I declare bankruptcy. >> Okay, so a record number of high-profile businesses going bankrupt is generally not a great indication of the health of the overall economy. And there are three factors really driving this surge. But before we blame everything exclusively on macro factors, we need to acknowledge some logical ironies. We are being told that these bankruptcies are the result of declining consumer demand and higher interest rates. But at the same time, we are also being told that consumer demand is up significantly and interest rates may be high compared to 5 years ago. But by historical standards, they are still very reasonable. The industries where these bankruptcies are happening is also important because without some important details, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. A report by PWC found that amongst the most affected industries were real estate, healthcare, and energy. We are told that healthcare is supposed to be recession proof. Real estate is hovering around all-time highs and energy has literally never had more demand thanks to AI data centers. So with these contradictory ideas in mind, the first reason for the bankruptcy boom has a lot more to do with the bankruptcy becoming an increasingly convenient tool up the arsenal of financeers. Now, I am not a bankruptcy attorney, and while we did consult one for writing this video, if you were planning to take your own billion-dollar company through the process, you might want to hire your own legal team. But in general, there are nine different types of bankruptcy. Rather confusingly, these are chapters 1 through 15. Some of these are for really specific cases, like chapter 12, which is for the reorganization of family farms and fisheries, or chapter 9, which is only for municipalities. However, for most of these big companies, there are really only two types of bankruptcy that are worth mentioning. Chapter 7 and Chapter 11. Chapter 7 is probably what you think of when you think of bankruptcy. The business or the individual has all of their assets collected and sold off. Depending on where they file, individuals may have some exemptions for things like their family home or a modest vehicle to get them to work. Either way, once these assets are liquidated, the proceeds from the sale are used to pay back debtors according to their seniority. And once that is done, the case is considered settled. However, there are still certain restrictions placed on the bankruptcy entity for a set period of time afterwards. For individuals, they may be limited from travel, certain jobs, or starting a business. And for businesses themselves, this kind of bankruptcy almost always means that it's basically game over. Operations will cease, staff will be laid off, and investors will be holding on to nothing of value. It's pretty grim, but it is also pretty straightforward. It's financial start from zero. However, most of the major companies you hear about going through bankruptcy don't take this route. They instead file for chapter 11. If you are a CEO of a company that files for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, you effectively hand over partial control of the business to a bankruptcy court, but for the immediate future, you are still allowed to run the business like normal, except that the people your business owes money to legally have to wait in line. Now, this isn't a get out of jail free card. The ultimate goal of the bankruptcy court is still to get the lenders their money back. But the difference in these cases is that often the biggest asset that big businesses like these have is the business itself. Brand recognition, ongoing contracts, a team of trained staff in place, and the systems to make them all work together. These components often have a greater value together than the sum of their parts individually. This means that often the best way to raise money to pay back everybody the business owes to is either to continue running the businesses and organize an extended payment plan. Or if that's too complicated, an even simpler solution is just to separate the business operations from the business itself and sell them free and clear of its debt to another potential buyer. This leaves behind a shell of a business with nothing in it apart from the money from the sale, which should hopefully cover the outstanding debt owed to lenders. This is the reason why you always hear about businesses declaring bankruptcy, but you still see them operating. And there are some clear reasons why this has become more popular. When a company is put up for sale while actively going through bankruptcy, it lets them do what is called a 363 sale, which has a lot of legal limitations, but it also has a lot of big and unintentional advantages, which makes them extremely attractive targets for private equity. If you look at some of the more high-profile bankruptcies from recent years, you will probably notice a trend. Del Monty filed for Chapter 11 and got additional loans to continue its operations until it could find a buyer. Claire's, the earpiercing boutique, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before being sold to a new buyer. And everybody's favorite family-friendly restaurant, Hooters, also filed for Chapter 11 before being sold off to the original owners who declared that they were going to rehooerize the brand. Whatever that means. Although, actually, I don't want to know. If you want another example, the sale of Dunder Mifflin from the office after the company went bankrupt was almost certainly some version of a 363 sale. The head office and the official company went bankrupt, but the actual paper pusher operations of the business were sold off to a new buyer. A 363 sale is normally done as quickly as possible so that lenders can get their money back. The company being sold is also legally motivated. And the fact that the business is sold free and clear by the courts, means that an acquirer, likely a private equity firm or competitor, can buy these companies with far less due diligence than they would otherwise require to make sure that there are no unforeseen liabilities. Before that sale even goes to auction, the bankruptcy court usually picks one buyer to go first and put a real number on the table. That opening bid sets a floor price and forces everyone else to either beat it or stop pretending they were interested. That first bidder is called the stocking horse, and they usually get a small breakup fee if someone else outbids them. The accelerated pace of a 363 sale also has some other hidden advantages when it comes to another regulator, but we will get to that later. A happy little irony of all of this is that once a private equity firm acquires a company, their first step is usually to load it up with even more debt to maximize their potential returns. A business with a lot of debt is more likely to run into financial difficulties in the future, making them more likely to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and in turn be sold off through a 363 sale. This has created some situations that would almost be comical if it wasn't for the fact that millions of jobs were on the line. A report by Bloomberg found that in 2023 and 2024, a total of 60 large companies filed for bankruptcy two times or more within the period. Party City, in particular, was sold off from over a billion dollars in debt. And then just 14 months later, it declared bankruptcy again. As the private equity industry has grown, it has naturally created a greater supply of companies pushing their finances to the extreme. And it's benefited from the greater supply of companies that pushed a little bit too far. It's a lovely little self-fulfilling system that has made declaring bankruptcy for businesses a lot like getting fired for workers any more than two decades ago. And these were both considered a big deal. But today, it's almost the expectation that it will eventually just happen to everybody at one point or another. However, to play devil's advocate, maybe this isn't such a bad thing. We have uh clearly been somewhat critical of private equity in the past on this channel, but that doesn't mean that just because they are involved, this should be instantly written off, right? If the actual operations of the company get sold wholesale and remain mostly intact, lenders get their money back without having to go through an extended arbitration process, the business might theoretically get better management. And most importantly, the regular employees won't lose their jobs in a company that ceases to exist. If this really were the only factor at play here, it would simultaneously explain why major bankruptcies have become so common outside of a recession, while simultaneously making it seem like there isn't actually anything to be worried about. But well, it's time to learn how many works to find out how this is creating much bigger problems just to sell a worse solution. One thing that we have noticed lately is that a lot of emerging tools are making our day-to-day work more productive. For us, that has shown up in places like storyboarding ideas faster for our editors, which means we can actually make more videos instead of getting stuck in planning, which is why this video is sponsored by Lovable. Lovable fits really naturally into that workflow. It lets you take an idea and turn it into a real working app or website in minutes. Even if you are not a developer, instead of spending hours setting up layouts, flows, or back-end logic, you just describe what you want to build and it handles the busy work. We can make quick visual edits like colors, spacing, and text, share it with the team, and once it is ready, publish it and have a live URL immediately. For us, it has been especially useful for storyboarding tools, internal dashboards, and quick prototypes where the goal is to just see the idea clearly and move on. It removes a lot of friction from the process so the focus stays on communicating the idea, not fighting the tooling.

One of the biggest hidden advantages of buying a business going through a chapter 11 bankruptcy is that everybody wants things to move as quickly as possible. Regular business acquisitions can take several months of back and forth negotiations. And major deals like whoever ends up owning Warner Brothers will probably take years of due diligence before the keys are handed over. Now, apart from costing a lot of money and fees to the lawyers and investment bankers that put these deals together, a regular protracted sale also gives more time for the FTC to step in and deem the sale to be anti-competitive. Bankruptcy sales are still technically beholden to that same kind of enforcement, but they normally get a much lighter touch for three simple reasons. The first is that the FDC doesn't really want to be the ones responsible for stopping a sale when the alternative is the business being liquidated and all of the workers losing their jobs. The second reason is that even if the FTC does block the sale and the company completely ceases to operate, then that doesn't really change anything anyway. There are still fewer competitors in the market. And the third reason is that these sales are normally rammed through so quickly that underfunded and understaffed regulators just don't have time to react. It's also important to remember that for a company to have the power to set their prices without competition, they don't need to be a monopoly nationwide. They just need to have a monopoly within a local area. When the pharmacy chain Ryade filed for bankruptcy last year for the second time, it sold off its individual operations to two major buyers, CVS and Walgreens. This expanded the areas of the national map where these two companies are the only option to fill a prescription or buy basic medication. Now, this is obviously bad, but if the bankruptcy boom really is just a result of increased corporate shenanigans, then at least it's not a recession indicator, right? So anyway, the second major driver of heightened corporate bankruptcies is that we are entering the find out stage of the business cycle. While companies continuously going through the bankruptcy cycle washer over and over again have skewed the statistics, those very same tricks are also suppressing a lot of figures as well. Some businesses now don't even go through the official chapter 11 process, choosing instead to settle with creditors directly by trading their debt for stock in their business, which can relatively easily be sold along in private equity markets. These figures are much harder to track because by definition, they are intentionally kept out of the public court system. But a report by Cornerstone Research, the same firm that has been tracking the large bankruptcies, found that these outofc court settlements hit a record high in the first half of 2025. So yeah, not only are there more official bankruptcies, there are now more hidden bankruptcies happening amongst major firms as well. As for the smaller businesses and even individuals, it's also important to remember that declaring bankruptcy is ironically really expensive. Hiring a bankruptcy lawyer and going through the court process generally costs thousands of dollars, which most people in genuine financial distress just don't have. All of this is to say that unfortunately this trend isn't exclusively just the result of businesses using the bankruptcy system as a convenient little packaging solution for their mergers and acquisitions. Interest rates have been far higher in the past and businesses on average survived much longer back then than they do now. But the difference is that today we are coming off almost two decades of extremely cheap money. In the past, borrowing money to run a business was seen as incredibly risky, if not downright irresponsible. Today, the culture has adapted to these cheap rates to the point where it's irresponsible not to leverage some debt in your operations. Again, the rise of private equity and their infinite financing loops definitely contributed to this trend. But even regular businesses have been systematically sold on the idea of using credit products like overdraft facilities to leverage their operations. Now, in a low interest rate environment, this is not inherently a bad idea. But when rates rise, it can quickly catch up with businesses and even individual people faster than they expect. You have probably heard about zombie companies, which are firms that have been kept alive after they should have died by a combination of low interest rates and generous government incentives. Well, over the last two decades, we have slowly cultivated a pretty large mob of these zombies, which means that naturally, as these support systems fall away, there will be an uptick in these companies meeting their inevitable fate. If anything, the most recent bankruptcy boom could be seen as making up for lost time. But that doesn't mean it's not dangerous. Even while in theory, new trends in business bankruptcy might maintain operations, they often don't. And even when they do, the second item on the agenda for the acquiring company after taking on even more debt is to cut down on operational expenses wherever possible. Most of the time that means closing underperforming locations or combining operations to save on costs. This has hit even usually resilient industries like healthcare. Policy shakeups around subsidies combined with heightened debt servicing costs have caused a lot of providers to get rolled in with competitors on bigger networks. From a patient perspective, this is not a great outcome because it clearly gives them fewer real options where they could get their care from. But it also means that doctors, nurses, and support staff may be in a position where all of the potential job opportunities within a reasonable distance of where they live are all being offered by the same healthcare group behind the scenes. Then of course there is the final piece of the puzzle, which is that even though consumer demand is strong overall, businesses are being stretched to serve one of two customers. The first are the budgetconscious shoppers who are extremely price sensitive and another group who have more disposable wealth than ever before who are paying exorbitant amounts of money for exclusive goods just so other wealthy people can't have it. The regular businesses in the middle are genuinely struggling the most with this trend and they are generally responsible for a lot of regular everyday jobs.
