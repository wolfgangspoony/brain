If you know two things about criminal procedure, one is probably you have the right to remain silent and the other is you need a warrant to enter someone's house and arrest them. But according to a secret leaked ICE legal memorandum, ICE thinks that they can just enter your house and arrest you without any criminal procedure whatsoever. It's 2026 people and the constitution is optional apparently. And that should scare absolutely everyone. There are very few things in the Constitution that are more clear than this. that the government can't break into your home without a warrant signed by a judge. Because under King George, you know, the tyrant that we rebelled against, British officers used what were called general warrants to barge into colonist homes without judicial approval. The Fourth Amendment was written to make sure that no government could ever do that again. So, naturally, in the year of our Lord 2026, we decided to do exactly that again. So, how did we get here? Well, whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization, represents two anonymous government officials who have revealed a very secretive and highly unconstitutional policy directive issued by ICE in May of 2025. And it looks like there was an actual cover up to make sure that this memo didn't see the light of day. One of the whistleblowers within ICE had been allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A totally legal thing when you're trying to train people on what is and is not constitutionally permissible. A second whistleblower was able to access the memo and lawfully disclose it to Congress through councel. The whistleblower report and a copy of the memo were leaked to the public. So now we have access to a copy of this internal ICE memo that tells officers they can forcibly enter homes and make arrests using only an administrative warrant rather than a warrant actually signed by a judge. That distinction matters because under the Fourth Amendment, those two pieces of paper are not interchangeable. In fact, while they share parts of the same name, they're about as similar as a French horn and a shoe horn. Now, an administrative warrant isn't really a warrant as we normally think about it. It's an internal agency document signed by someone who works within the agency instead of a judge from the judiciary branch, which authorizes an arrest for an immigration violation. That administrative warrant allows someone to be arrested, but that's really it. It lets you arrest someone on public property, but it doesn't give them the right to make a force entry into a private residence. In contrast, judicial warrants must be signed by a judge and specify who or what ICE is seeking. No one is obligated to answer the door for ICE or allow agents into a home unless they have a judicial warrant. But of course, we keep seeing ICE agents forcibly entering homes without any warrant at all and without consent. And we've also seen DHS officers trying to pass off administrative warrants as judicial warrants. In fact, this just happened to Chong Lee Scott Tao, an American citizen from St. Paul. ICE agents burst into his home without showing a judicial warrant while searching for two other people, handcuffed him in front of his grandson, and detained him outside in freezing temperatures, wearing only underwear and a blanket. They eventually released him hours after they discovered he was not the target. So, if you were wondering just where does ICE get off thinking that it has a right to do this, well, it's not just rogue agents. They apparently wrote this down and trained people on it. Yes, they are being told it's legal. Now, the government may not care about your rights or your privacy, but if you do, now is probably a good time to wipe all of your personal and private information off of the internet. Your cell phone number, home address, email address, private social media accounts, and tons of sensitive data are shockingly easy to purchase by anyone online. But malicious actors can't hurt you if they can't find you. And so, you can fight back and take control of your private information by signing up for today's sponsor, Incogn. Because Incogn wipes your personal data from the internet by searching the internet, reaching out to data brokers and websites directly on your behalf, and forcing them to remove your private information. If they resist, incogn will take care of that too because incogn fights back. But what makes incogn truly powerful in taking back control of your privacy is the custom removal speed. It allows you to flag an unlimited number of sites where your data is exposed. And you can even have incogn's privacy experts review and tackle the most uncooperative data brokers and search sites. Now I've been using incogn for years now. And in that time, you can see I've been on hundreds of lists, some of which had a high sensitivity score, meaning the broker had tons of data on me. Luckily, Incogn has completed hundreds of takedowns for me in that time. Now, I can never do this myself. So, thank you to Incogn for weeks worth of work and adding me to over 40 suppression lists. And Incogn will continue to conduct ongoing removals because even if the broker removes your data once, they can always collect it and publish it again. So, if online privacy is important to you, give Incogn try. If you scan the code on screen or click on the link in the description, you'll get 60% off their annual unlimited plan. Or try Incognree for 30 days. If you decide to keep it, you'll still get the 60% off discount so long as use my code legal eagle, all one word at checkout. So sign up for incogn or I'll see you in court. The leaked memo directly conflicts with this little thing known as the fourth amendment uh which is supposed to protect us against unreasonable searches and seizures. But let's dive into this monstrosity. on the top of the page dated May 12th, 2025 from acting ICE director Todd Lions. The money quote says, quote, "Although the US Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Council has recently determined that the US Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Immigration Regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose." What is the authority for this position? not a court decision, not a statute, certainly not the Constitution. It's a Trump executive order, which, as we've explained many times on this channel, is not law. It then explains, quote, "Essential to the removal of aliens subject to final orders of removal is the ability to locate and arrest them. So, you're telling me that in order to deport someone, you have to find them." Wow, these guys are real geniuses. Now, when there has been a formal order of removal, ICE drafts form I 205, which allows agents to arrest the individual. Supervisors execute form I205 and ICE agents will serve that paperwork and take the person into custody. This is nothing new. But here's the sketchy part. Quote, "Accordingly, in light of this legal determination, ICE immigration officers may arrest and detain aliens subject to a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or a US District Court judge or magistrate judge in their place of residence. ICE immigration officers should consider all available enforcement mechanisms, including the use of form I205 to arrest an alien in their place of residence to achieve the requirements of Executive Order 14159 in accordance with applicable law and policies. In the next section, the lines memo claims that the form along with the order of removal are quote important because that order establishes probable cause. Except that no, it doesn't. This is not a criminal proceeding. This is not a golden ticket to give probable cause under all circumstances. The memo doesn't bother to cite law here, but there is a footnote that contains an even more sweeping assertion of power. Quote, "This scoping is not intended to concede that an administrative warrant would be insufficient to arrest an alien in his or her place of residence prior to a formal order of removal or where there is a final order of removal issued by an immigration officer." So, in layman's terms, what this footnote is doing is saying that even though this memo purports to grant sweeping power that has never existed to the executive branch and is actually contrary to all constitutional law, it actually might go further that maybe you don't even need a final order of removal to be able to conduct these warrantless arrests. This is an astonishing claim, but of course, ICE has been throwing around dubious paperwork to justify unconstitutional acts for a while now. Remember Kilmar Rego Garcia? As Liz Dy explained in her latest update, the government never had a final order of removal in his case. So in December, an administrative judge issued a removal order and backdated it to 2019. It's just Calvin Ball all the way down at this point. But that's exactly why the law doesn't consider orders drafted by ICE employees to be on the same level as orders given by judges. ICE orders aren't written up by an impartial magistrate. But moving on to the next paragraph, which says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence. Agents should quote generally only do these raids between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m. and the people inside must be given quote reasonable chance to act lawfully. But if that doesn't work, the memo says they can use force to go in. Quote, "Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien's residence following the proper notification of the officer or agents authority and intent to enter. And this is where we need to pause and talk about why this is such a constitutional red line. The Supreme Court has said that physical entry into the home is the quote chief evil the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent. That quote is from a Supreme Court case which rejected Richard Nixon's claim that the president could bypass warrants for domestic threats. The Fourth Amendment was written in response to colonial era general warrants and rits of assistance which let officers search homes without specific judicial approval. The entire point of the warrant requirement is that a neutral judge decides when the government can cross that threshold. You know, checks and balances. But ISIS is essentially arguing that a notice of removal issued by an immigration judge who isn't really a judge. They are an employee of the executive branch is enough to supplant the need for a judicial warrant based on probable cause. And even if that were true, which it isn't, it would be trivially easy for ICE to take the notice of removal to a judge and get them to issue a real arrest warrant. But an order of removal is not a replacement for probable cause or a warrant. In fact, a removal order isn't even a criminal undertaking at all. Oh, and by the way, adding insult to injury, the Trump administration job postings for immigration judges now calls them deportation judges, which kind of highlights why you need a real judge to issue a real warrant to enter and arrest someone. Under current Supreme Court doctrine, the Fourth Amendment bars warrantless home entry for arrest unless there is a judicial warrant or exigent circumstances. In Payton versus New York, the court explained that an arrest warrant must be issued by a neutral magistrate, not by the executive branch before law enforcement can break down someone's door and make an arrest. That's why this memo's claim that administrative warrant suffice is so radical. It asserts exactly what Payton and related cases reject. So, what is the government's legal theory here? Why would ICE think an administrative warrant can replace a judge's warrant? Well, as law professor and Fourth Amendment expert Orin Kurr speculates, it might be based on a reading of Abel versus United States, a Supreme Court case from 1960, where the court upheld an immigration arrest in a hotel room. Now, the AEL case has never been overturned, but it came 20 years before Payton versus New York. The case that made it clear that the government needs a judicial warrant to enter a home. And the AEL case didn't even approve forced entry into someone's home. Hotel staff cooperated, and the court never addressed breaking down doors, curdage, or modern consent doctrine. The modern rule starts with Payton versus New York. Then in Stagold versus United States, the court went further and ruled that even a valid arrest warrant does not allow police to enter someone else's home to look for the subject without consent. The Fourth Amendment protects the house itself, not just the person being arrested. Which is why Scott Tao and many like him should never have been ripped from his home by armed ICE agents who were looking for someone else and probably did not have consent to enter that home. And that's the doctrine the courts apply today. But the ICE memo appears to site no law whatsoever in making this general policy. And actually worse, in a footnote, the ICE memo admits that this new policy can't even apply in Los Angeles in the Central District of California because of a court decision that runs 100% counter to what they're saying. The case referenced is called Kid versus Morcus, which was a class action lawsuit that challenged ISIS's knock and talk tactics in the Los Angeles area. Under this practice, ICE would enter the constitutionally protected private areas around individuals homes like the porch or backyard to arrest occupants without consent or judicial warrant. But the district court, the trial court held that ISIS's practice of entering the curelage of homes to make arrests without a judicial warrant or valid consent violates the fourth amendment. Now, the government settled the kid case in 2025 and they agreed not to engage in deceptive tactics during knock-in talks such as misidentifying themselves as state or local cops. And they also agreed not to enter a home without a warrant or consent, quote, for the purposes of arresting residents. And the government ultimately settled the kid case, but the lines memo makes it clear that they did not accept the judge's constitutional analysis. I mean, we're only guessing here, but it's likely the government is now arguing that an immigration officer who signs a form I 205 should count as a judicial officer for Fourth Amendment purposes. In other words, executive branch officials can function as the equivalent of judges. And the administration is trying to make hay out of the fact that administrative warrant and judicial warrant are homophones of each other. Somehow Yale law graduate JD Vance said, >> "But nobody is talking about doing immigration enforcement without a warrant. We're talking about different types of warrants that exist in our system. Typically what happens, not always, but typically in the immigration system, those are handled by administrative law judges. So we're talking about getting warrants from those administrative law judges." >> And he's just wrong. Immigration judges do not even issue administrative warrants. The warrant is generated and signed by ICE officers. If you fill out an I205 form, that form is signed by the ICE officer, which is why ISIS's training materials say they don't justify a home search. An immigration judge will sign a final order of removal, but that's not the same thing. And Vance is also wrong about administrative law judges or ALJs in that immigration judges are not even classified as administrative law judges. As Professor Murray says here, understanding administrative due process is a difficult process because it's not the same as civil or criminal due process. It might be okay to have ICE serve a warrant, but what is not okay breaking into your home or your car based on this somewhat lesser warrant. And that's why a lot of the earlier ICE actions were at courouses. They were apprehending people in public where it is legal. And just to show you, here's what a judicial warrant looks like signed by a judge. That's from the National Immigration Law Center. And here's what an administrative warrant looks like. Note the signature block. And to add insult to injury, the man that they mistook Tao for, Lu Muau, well, they should have known where he was because he was already in prison. But Judge Wright addressed that in Kid versus Mayorcis. And as he pointed out, Fourth Amendment cases emphasized the need for a neutral and detached magistrate. Quote, "Case law supports the need for independent judgment in issuing warrants." And he cites Shadwick versus City of Tampa, where the Supreme Court said, quote, "The warrant traditionally has represented an independent assurance that a search and arrest will not proceed without probable cause. Thus, an issuing magistrate must be neutral and detached. To which the judge cited Kulage versus New Hampshire, where the Supreme Court observed that quote, "The whole point of the basic rule is that prosecutors and policemen simply cannot be asked to maintain the requisite neutrality with regard to their own investigations." And that's also consistent with ICE training materials, which affirm that quote, "Administrative warrants do not authorize entry into a dwelling without consent." At least that's what their non-secret training materials say. But this new secret memo directly contradicts DHS's 2025 legal training manual issued by its Office of Chief Counsel, which says, quote, "The physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed. Entering a home to arrest a person without a judicial warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement is typically a violation of the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether the officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect. An officer who enters a person's home to make an arrest must have one, a warrant, two, consent, or three, an exigent circumstance." And the memo also contradicts DHS's training materials on executing removal orders. Quote, "An administrative arrest warrant does not alone authorize a Fourth Amendment search of any kind." The Secret Lines memo also conflicts with ISIS's fugitive operations handbook, which is quote, "neether a warrant for arrest of alien I200, nor a warrant of removal, I 205, authorizes officers to enter the target's residence or anywhere else where the target has a reasonable expectation of privacy. A government intrusion into an area where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purposes of gathering information will trigger Fourth Amendment protections, including a physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area. Therefore, without a criminal warrant, officers must obtain voluntary consent before entering a residence or area where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Now, the memo is addressed to all ICE officers, but has not been distributed to all of them. According to the whistleblowers, it's being shown to quote select DHS officials who are then directed to verbally brief the new policy for action. Those supervisors then show the memo to some employees like our clients and direct them to read the memo and return it to the supervisor. Yes, you're reading that right. The memo is deemed too hot to even show to rank and file ICE agents. And the agency fired employees who objected to the unconstitutional policy. It says, quote, "A seasoned government instructor chose to resign rather than be forced to teach what they understood to be unlawful." This is evidence that the people who drafted the Lions memo have knowledge that it is illegal. It also shows that some of the employees have been retaliated against for opposing the illegal policy. And the complaint reiterates that ICE leadership knows that the form I 205 is not a real warrant. Quote, "Form I 205 has not been considered a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate. Only a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate would authorize ICE agents to enter or search non-public areas such as an alien's residence." So to recap, ICE leadership knows administrative warrants aren't real warrants. Their own training says you can't enter homes this way, and Congress's own legal experts agree. Oh, and ICE wants to hide this memo from the public and also the people who are supposed to be implementing this new policy. Which brings up an important question. Is the lines memo evidence of a criminal conspiracy? I don't know, man, but that definitely seems like a conspiracy against rights under the civil rights laws. Now, all this highlights why it's so important to get a great lawyer when you're dealing with your own case. Now, after I started this channel, every week I'd get hundreds of comments and emails from viewers who are dealing with legal problems, and they'd ask, "Can you help me find a lawyer?
