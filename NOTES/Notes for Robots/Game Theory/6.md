today I want to examine why you Chinese students behave the way you do okay so believe it or not but the way that you behave the game that you are playing it's strange it's weird so I'll point out three things that you do that don't really make any sense the first thing that you do is you spend a lot of your time learning English in fact you probably spend more time learning English than you do learning Chinese that's weird and I've asked Chinese students before why they are so focused on learning English and their answers usually are I want to learn knowledge i want to go abroad i want to communicate i want to use the internet that's not really a good explanation okay so that's one thing that's weird second thing that's weird is you're obsessed with making money especially US dollars okay and the third thing that's weird is that your goal in life is to immigrate to a western country uh specifically United States right you all want to go United States for college get a degree and hopefully stay there get a good job but as we discussed before that's strange because you are much higher status in China you're much more likely to get a good job you're much more likely to marry a bit of a woman than you are United States where the game is rigged against you okay so this sort of behavior is weird if you think about it what you should be really trying to do is master Chinese because once you master Chinese and given your family background given the fact that your family is often wealthy and well connected in China you can climb up pretty high in China okay so if you want if you learn Chinese you're far better able to communicate yourself you're far more uh likely to gain respect and status in China okay but instead you learn English um US dollars doesn't make any sense what you really want is status right what you really want is to be well respected you want a prestigious job you want to marry a beautiful woman you want to have lots and lots of children that's what you really want but instead you're really focused on obtaining US dollars that's kind of strange now the last thing we said was immigration you if you go to um United States it's really a rigged game against you right the most that you can hope to obtain is maybe become an engineer or professor if you're really really smart but you're not going to achieve political power you're not going to become a CEO of a major company all right so the situation as it is it's really weird where the best in Brighton China they just want to be common people in the United States or Britain or Canada so it's a really weird game and so the question we want I want to look at today is how was this game constructed why do we play this game and the answer I will show you is because of the British okay the British Empire create this game that ultimately the Americans inherit and which the entire world world's played today because America is the global superpower um okay does that make sense all right so first I want to go into some history and explain to you how we got to where we are so this is the map of the Spanish Empire at the height of its power as you can see the Spanish Empire cover the entire globe okay so this is a spa small nation in Spain and it was able to really cover the entire world so how was this accomplished okay so the first thing you need to understand is that for most of its history Europe was a very poor place and in order for it to obtain wealth it had to trade with the world specifically it wanted spices from what what they call the East Indies okay Southeast Asia um at this time in history the main power were the Muslims who are here okay and if you if you want to trade with um East Asia you have to go through the Muslims and at this point in history uh Spain is Muslim it's it's a it's a place called uh Andu Lassa but then the Christians were able to reconquer Spain and so the Muslims decided that we'll just blockade you or if you want to trade with us we will charge you a lot of levies okay and so now the Spanish and the Portuguese are forced to look for new routes to these indies where the spices are remember at this time in history spices are the most valuable commodity they're actually worth more than gold okay I'm talking like cinnamon nutmeg pepperc corn okay these spices are extremely valuable commodities in fact one ship um if you if you're able to bring bring one ship of these spices back to Europe well you had intergenerational wealth okay you become one of the wealthiest people in Europe that's how valuable these spices were and so now the the Spanish and the Portuguese have no choice but to discover new routes to these indies so they went this way and this is hard because um Africa is not really hospitable there are a lot of viruses diseases in Africa so they they started to go so they start to explore all around the world and they went to North America and South America and when they went to North and South America they discovered that there were already peoples the Aztecs the Incas living there and they had a lot of wealth because these were empires and they could easily conquer and so they set up these colonies all around um South America and a lot of silver was now being transported back to Spain and so overnight Spain became extremely wealthy but as we discussed last class if you become too wealthy and too powerful you changed as a people before you were energetic you were open you were cohesive that's what made you an empire but now all this wealth you become insular you become arrogant and you become extremely closeminded okay you become lazy and so the Spanish they had all this wealth and they decided that they really don't they want to work anymore okay so so what happened well what happened was that they start to subcontract um their labor to other places okay so um so now what's going to happen is you will have the rise of England French and the Dutch Republic mainly okay to to provide textiles luxury goods to um Spain right so how this was accomplished was first industry so the Spanish because they were so wealthy didn't want to work and their people didn't have to work either okay so but they wanted to buy clothes nice clothes so what happened was they got other nations to be the factories including Britain the Dutch Republic and France okay that's the first thing second thing that happened was trade okay so the Spanish um did engage in trade but now that they're so wealthy they could just hire the Dutch to do it okay now the Dutch were responsible for going to the East Indies and bringing back uh the spices because it's a very dangerous job right you could you could get sick you could die along the way um you could also lose a lot of money okay and the reason why the Dutch agreed to this is that the Dutch was basically a colony of the Spanish so the Spanish had an empire and the Dutch were part of this empire so they just made the Dutch gold do it for them okay but the third thing that happened um was piracy okay so all this silver was being transported from the new world back to Spain and what the uh English realized is hey we engage in piracy and steal this silver for ourselves okay all right so now the English became very wealthy because of piracy okay and the most famous pirate of this time of course was surf as Drake and he worked directly under the monarch Elizabeth the first okay so this was a state sponsored piracy that made um Britain very wealthy okay so now you have this divergence where okay you have the Spanish empire and because of their wealth they became u lazy insular and arrogant or the word we use is hubris okay lazy is you just make others do it for you okay insular just means that now as we discussed last class the Spanish aren't concerned about other nations they think they're invincible so they engage in court politics okay they're all infighting for the throne the last thing is arrogant hubris which basically means that you believe you are invincible you can do whatever you want and therefore you start all these wars against everyone everywhere you overextend yourself and you don't really understand your limitations as an empire so very quickly even though Spain becomes very wealthy very fast they also go bankrupt very fast because they're fighting too many wars they're spending too much money that they don't have okay and they're too corrupt okay does that make sense now and what and because of this what's happening is that the uh British uh England the Dutch and the French they are slowly becoming a much more um energetic open and cohesive society cohesion okay and now that you have this differentiation what's going to happen is that the religion is going to change okay so um Spain remains Catholic and it's going to fight to control the Vatican and this um okay so that's what Spain does now Britain and the Dutch need to differentiate themselves from Spain and so they become Protestant or we call Calvinist okay so imag so Catholic is really about obeying authority but the Protestant the Calvinist religion insists on hard work on energy on obtaining wealth okay the problem though is that um the Spanish are too powerful and the French some of them are Calvinist but most are Catholic okay so what's going to happen is that the English and the Dutch are going to decide to join forces okay so I want to show very quickly show you the difference between the Catholic religion and the Protestant religion okay so these are the Spanish and as you can see there's a lot of trade going between the new world and Spain why is this the case because Spain is extracting resources from the new world primarily silver okay um the French are also engaged in trade as well so they're what what they really want is fur from North America so fur is a cuz you're a luxury at that time but as you can see from this map the people that are really engaged in trade enga engaged in piracy in trade in shipping are the British okay and the Dutch and the reason why is that they're poor okay and so through this hard work they become very wealthy very quickly in fact the Dutch in fact become the wealthiest nation in the world per capita you have this burgeoning of the middle class and so what happens now is that the spa the Spanish and the Dutch come into conflict because remember the Dutch are a colony of the Spanish and so the the Spaniards want the Dutch pay more taxes and the Dutch want to be more independent so this starts a series of wars okay in fact an entire series of wars starts throughout Europe called the 30 years war okay so ostensibly it's a it's a religious conflict between the Protestants and the Catholics but there are lots of underlying re there are other underlying factors as well okay another factor is the Spaniards want to exert control over the Dutch okay and so there's lots of different reasons but but the main thing you need to know is that millions and millions of people die in fact it is the deadliest war in Europe right before up until the World War I okay and so this creates anxiety in Europe because if there's all this war and you're joining all this wealth how do you keep this wealth secure right you you're a merchant you became very wealthy through trade by going to East Indies and getting spices and come back to Europe and selling them but if the Spanish or the French are going to send an army and steal everything how do you keep your gold safe okay so what's going to happen is this what's going to happen is that the British and the Dutch are going to decide to get married okay this is what we call the Glorious Revolution 1688 Glorious Revolution so let's talk about the Glorious Revolution in the glorious revolution what happens is that the British nobility invite Will Orange who is um a leader of the Dutch Republic to come and become the monarch of Britain okay and so you you're like okay why would they do that why would they um betray their own king I install a um for monarch William orange okay and so the thing you need to understand is that throughout British history what makes Britain unique is that the monarch has always been conflict with the nobility okay the king has always been conflict with the oligarchs and this is this is a continuous pattern so ostensibly the reason is religious because chi was Catholic and uh Britain is a protestant country but the real reason is the nobility want to exert authority over the country okay so in this agreement what would happen is that parliament becomes the sovereign state okay it becomes the de facto power in uh England and the king with orange agrees to be the puppet or the figurehead but the real power is in parliament and so this creates the idea of national sovereignty okay what people don't appreciate is that the real reason why they want to do that is they want to protect capital okay capital okay or transnational so the idea is that not only does one of the orange come over but most of Dutch wealth come over because remember at this time the Dutch have a huge problem they're constantly being invaded by Spain so what you do is you take all the gold in the Dutch Republic and you transfer over it to England okay and so in 1694 they creat the idea is this the idea is that if you buy the Bank of England that gold is yours okay but the Bank of England will always be guaranteed by Parliament all right so this is a very important idea guys i I need you to understand this for the rest of the semester okay so before you're a king and you you need to go fight a war you bore money from bankers and merchants right the problem though is that one you could lose the war in which case oops second is that um you could die in which case oops and the third and the third problem is that you could just say I'm king i'm not going to give you back your money okay and so these merchants would have no choice but to try to create a revolution okay but but as a merchant as a capitalist you don't want to go through this process and so the Bank of England it's really important because now you are lending money not to the king but to the nation okay what this means is that the nation has to pay you back so even though the king dies the people are liable for the debt okay does that make sense all right so now if you're a merchant you feel safe i can now put my money in the Bank of England it's my money if I lend it to the nation I'm always guaranteed that they'll pay me back okay and England is safe because unlike the Dutch Republic England is an island and therefore it's protected by the Royal Navy it's impossible for the French the Hapsburg Empire or the Spanish to invade England they they never able to conquer England and so it makes England safe okay all right so now the question is why would the Dutch why would they put their money in England because remember at this time they just screw you over okay so the way the way around this is you have some old techniques you have inner marriage right and you have religion or we call secret societies because remember both um both um the Dutch Republic and England are Calvinists okay and the major society that facilitated trade of course were were the Freemasons but during this time these two were really between aristocrats and the Bank of England was trying to get as much money as possible right so what they started to develop was a uh new concept it's not a new concept but they really systemized it it's called contract law all right so there's a famous British philosopher named John Loach and he said that what is government for government is provides the alienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of property all right what that means is a government ensures you three rights we will protect your safety we'll make sure you won't die okay we will make sure you have the right to do whatever you want liberty and also we will protect your private property okay the entire purpose of parliament and the courts okay the judicial system is to ensure that your private property is protected no matter where your private property came from okay it doesn't matter they don't care what the origin of private property is okay so like if you're French and you killed a million people to steal a million gold they don't care it's yours it's private okay if if if it's if it's and they believe that this private property comes from God all right this is yours because God willed it to be yours and we England must protect it and they will do so through Parliament and through the court system okay does that make sense so now if you're wealthy in Europe you're now encouraged to go invest in England okay and this creates a concept that today we call offshore financial center or OFC okay so think of like Dubai or Hong Kong where they don't care where the money comes from okay their legal system the financial system system will help protect this money okay also Switzerland okay so Switzerland is a classic example but England create this and they based their entire nation around this idea okay now the first major test to the system was Napoleon because Napoleon was about to conquer Europe and England couldn't have that because if um Napoleon conquers Europe then Napoleon could control all the wealth of Europe he could make sure that no wealth is transferred over to England he he basically blockade England so what Britain did was they financed seven wars against Napoleon and they lost six of these wars and they won the last war which quit the British Empire okay so now Britain is a global financial empire okay so this is a East India company okay and the East Indian company uh it's based in Britain and like the Bank of England is private and what it does is it primarily engages in trade it with India as well as the East Indies okay um so what England will do is they will colonize India and steal all the wealth of India primarily by de-industrializing India so India had textile factories but England uh through a lot of um um policies just bankrupt the India textile industry and transferred over to England okay so now what's going to happen is this what's going to happen is that uh resources from England sorry resources from India okay agricultural products resources are going to transfer over to England england is is going to with its factories make goods for India so basically the entire deal is we Britain give you India $10 and India you give $1,000 okay so every so basically we give you a dollar for the goods you give us and and then you pay us $1,000 for the goods we give you okay so very quickly this backup England but not only uh sorry this sorry this back to India okay but not only that but you also have China as well and the same idea was the opium went into uh China and then silver and money went back to England okay and then this money was allowed to go over to the United States the United States industrialized very quickly because of this policy now the question is how was England able to do this how is England able to create a system in which India and China basically voluntarily gave up its wealth and the answer is England simply game that incentivize the local elites to cooperate with um England okay so this is the way um this is what happened so this is a map of uh the British Empire okay so let's look at India and China the local elites had to help the British do this okay the local elites had to help the British steal the question then is why would the local elites do that okay and the reason why is remember from last class the local local elites are in conflict with each other anyway okay and what they're looking for is more power and so what England said to local leads is if you help us we will help you steal the gold from this country okay do you understand before if you were an elite and you lost a war or other people didn't like you they could kill you but now if you help the British you can transfer your wealth and your children abroad okay does that make sense so now what's going to happen is that the elite are going to be able to send their children and their wealth to the British Empire okay okay and there are certain mechanisms that allow them to accomplish this the first mechanism is of course um finance okay so not only are you allowed to transfer your capital to uh the United Kingdom and its colonies but they will disguise it for you this is what we call money laundering okay money laundering so when you steal from your people not only will Britain allow you to do this but they will discuss it for you okay through their offshore financial centers including Hong Kong Singapore their lawyers will pretend that this money came from not from drugs not from gambling not from prostitution but from restaurants from real estate who cares okay but they'll clean up for you okay we call this money laundering and then they will help you send it overseas where it becomes legitimate okay so now you have real estate investments in Australia or Canada okay all right so this is a global money laundering system that encourages the local elites to be corrupt okay it protects them in the corruption and incentivizes them in the corruption okay does it make sense the second thing that allows this to happen is schooling okay so what do I mean by that the British when they conquered India and um China what they were trying to do is try to brainwash indoctrinite so they set up these schools right and when you went to these schools what what what did you learn you learn English but when you learn English what do you learn you learn that British culture is superior to your local culture right when you're learning English you're learning about Shakespeare you're learning about British philosophy you're learning British history and as a result you slowly come to believe that the British are superior to us and therefore I should try my best to be British okay and also what's really important is that the schooling system allows for mobility okay so if you are a really smart person in China well there's really little mobility for you in China but if you go for the British system you might win a scholarship to go study at Oxford or Cambridge okay you even might become a world scholar so a world scholar it's a basically a secret society okay guys but the idea is that all over the British Empire the very best students will be selected to go to Oxford where they become best friends okay and their mission will be to spread the power of the British Empire all around the world and it works really well okay this is an indoctrination system for local elites and it it works really well because remember if you're a really smart person the British offer you more opportunities for mobility than your own country because in your own country the system is very hierarchal it's static there's really no mobility right but if you're really smart and you obey the British and you believe that the British culture is the very best in the world you might become a world scholar and then you become part of the British Empire okay and that's how the British were able to conquer the world and the third thing of course is the navy basically the navy ensured that Britain was the greatest military power in the world if they didn't like you they would come and destroy you okay that's what happened to China during the open wars there's nothing that could destroy the navy and so these three things okay finance the bank of England basically schooling or the idea of soft power British culture English okay and the third thing is the navy created really the world's first great world empire so as you can see Britain spread all around the world okay and this and so even though the British Empire is no longer around it's now the American empire higher even though the opium trade has stopped what's important for us to understand is the game is still being played today okay so let let me give you an example of this this is a drug trade in the world okay and as you can see the drug trade okay primary cocaine we're talking about cocaine there are other types of drugs as well but let's focus on cocaine you can see it's a global network um just like a lot of cocaine is produced in Colombia and South America and then it just travels all around the world it's a very sophisticated system of trade okay but what you need you you need to understand is none of this would be possible without the British financial and legal system okay because like why are they why are people taking such a risk and selling drugs because it's so lucrative it's so profitable but you can only have this market if it's being protected by a legal and financial system okay people only participate in this trade it's dangerous but they only participate participate in this trade if they can be guaranteed that they can make a lot of money then and they can use this money and protect this money okay so what protects this money of course is the offshore financial centers okay so the green areas in the world in which you can place your money they won't ask where the money came from they don't care where the money came from and they will clean it up for you okay money laundering they will use their sophisticated legal and financial systems to clean up your money and then they will help you invest it elsewhere okay does it make sense so this is So guess what look at this guys where are the major um global financial offshore centers well they're in the Caribbean okay they're in Panama they are in uh northern Europe they are in the Middle East they are in Southeast Asia hong Kong Singapore Japan guess what guys this used to be the former British Empire okay so the British Empire is still around today but they they transform from one that is overt and that is that uses military power in order to control the world to one that is covert that is secret and that uses financial and legal means in order to control the world okay and it's still the game that we play today all right now um there's a question that someone asked me okay it's a very good question the question is this if offshore financial centers like Hong Kong and Dubai are so profitable and it's such easy money why doesn't everyone do it right and and the it's it's the it's a it's a good question okay and the logic is very simple we know that gambling prostitution human trafficking slavery all profitable why does everyone do it because it's immoral okay as a society you need morality in create energy openness and cohesion right people want to feel as though they're part of something good that they're that we're serving for a higher cause and if you're all about slavery or prostitution or gambling or money laundering people won't feel good about themselves in fact the souls become corrupted okay so the classic example is like Hong Kong right have you guys been to Hong Kong one of the wealthiest cities in the world right lots and lots of skyscrapers but guess what the people there are disgusting they're depraved they're unethical they're disgusting there's actually no culture to the place there's no morality to the place it's actually disgusting okay i don't want to live there and if you live there guess what your soul is going to become corrupted so this is almost you would say this is a demonic system this system is not only evil but it facilitates evil it is the work of Satan okay but unfortunately this is a system that we live in today um so even though everyone will say this isn't demonic it really it's really underpins the world today because if you think about it okay okay all this corrupt money from China uh India uh Malaysia they go to these places but then this money then goes goes where it goes over to Australia to invest in real estate okay do you guys know what the biggest industry in Australia is it's banking okay banking which means that Australia also engages in money laundering but they clean it up so people aren't aware of this do you understand but same happens in Canada as well canada United States as well so this entire world it's based on stealing from the third world and transferring this money to the first world that's all it is okay it's that complicated but this has led to a huge problem the problem is what we call over financialization but over financialization it's a very similar concept where there's too much money so people become corrupt lazy arrogant and insular and that's what's happening in Canada in United States in Britain in Australia okay and so really an empire must collapse at some point so the British the western world they are a victim of their own success okay so they stole all this money from the rest of the world but this money has made the past made their people lazy corrupt and arrogant and that's why we're seeing so much conflict right now in the western world because this um um money has created a lot of inequality in the world in the western world right where maybe 1% of all the money 9% have very little to get by on but you also have a lot of corruption where the political system no longer serves the interest of the people they only serve the interests of the rich okay and then you will also have immorality where nowadays people only concerned about making money they don't want to contribute to the community okay so yes we can say that the western world it's evil because they've stolen all this money but really what what's happened is that they've corrupt corrupted and destroyed themselves because this model has been too successful for them okay and that's why we're seeing so much chaos in the world today so we are really at a game reset or a game's end and a new game is about to emerge because this game right now is not sustainable okay all right any questions yeah so if the success of western world leads to the corruption and you know the fall of western world can we generalize that you know after success people will fall then what's the meaning of success okay that's um a great question okay so if you know that you become successful you will not be happy why do people um go and succeed and okay this is a really um hard question to answer okay so let me explain different layers okay the first layer is this why people know that wealth doesn't lead to happiness right what leads to happiness is family love community meaning purpose generosity okay that's what leads to happiness the happiest people in the world tend to be religious they tend to have families and they tend to be very kindhearted people so why do why do we have rich people because a game is structured so that everyone is forced to play okay meaning that um we only care about people like Ellen Musk or Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg we we worship the rich okay um and we hate the poor so if you're homeless we think it's because you deserve it because you're lazy it's because you refuse to work okay so the game is set up so that we're focused on making money then the question then is why do you have this stupid game and the answer unfortunately is that what we figured out is that this game in the short term in the short term not the long term okay we're talking like decades not centuries in the short term it's what makes your people the most energetic open cohesive and the most likely to win against other nation states okay does that make sense so in the long term you get destroyed your people are destroyed you're corrupt you're corrupted by this game but in the short term it allows you to defeat other players okay that's how the British were able to create the empire because they defeated the French they defeat the Germans they defeat the Russians okay and that forces the other players to play this game as well because in the short term this game it um this game gives you huge advantages okay so think of it's a zero sum game think of a Olympic game where okay Evan's going and competing in the 100 meter sprint and we know you shouldn't do drugs because drugs will destroy your body right and you could have a heart attack when you're 40 but they're like "No no no i really want to win this game." So they So one guy uses a drug and he wins and the other players know about this and now they're forced to also use the same tactic okay do do you understand so it's it's a really unfortunate system in that this system can only lead to the unhappiness corruption uh and immorality of people but people are too concerned about short-term rewards okay if you don't play this game then you get eliminated okay what I'll discuss in next class okay is uh the American Empire and how the American Empire changed this game right so what the American Empire will do is it will add US dollars to this game and it's important because it makes the game universal now as well as easier to play okay and then we'll look at how the system capitalism conquered the world okay so so it's a great question but the reality is that um if you cheat if you do bad things in the short term you will win out even though in the long term it will lead to severe consequences for you and your people okay does it make sense okay i mean and it's also the same thing as like you know rich people right rich people to get rich they will sacrifice their children's happiness they will sacrifice their own happiness but but they think that this will lead to happiness in the future it won't but but they believe it okay so that's the great tragedy of this game does that make sense okay good any more questions okay good so we'll continue this next class okay
