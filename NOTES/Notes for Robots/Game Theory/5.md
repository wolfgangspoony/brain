today we examine the question why is it that states countries nations they rise and they fall okay so let's start off with an example that you know pretty well so this is the waring states period and at this point in history there are many powerful states okay so for example the true the jao the way okay and if at this point in history this is about 250 uh B.CE i asked you to figure out using game theory which state would unite China and become the first great empire of China well there are certain metrics that you would use to figure out which state would win out okay so obviously you would look at population okay who has the largest population okay so the question of mass second question that you would look at is maybe resources right and resources it's basically just farmland so you would look at basically which areas had the most rivers okay and so you would be like okay well this area um you know looks very strategic as is this area as is this area okay and then you would also look at maybe technology so basically which state has the most scientist which state has the most advanced literature arts and then from the these metrics then you could do some analysis and figure out that maybe true would come conquer all of China at some point okay but at no point using any metrics would you assume that Ting would conquer China and there are certain reasons why first of all it's in mountains so it's pretty poor second of all it's it's pretty away far away from the rivers and trade routes and third of all it's pretty isolated okay so for you could not possibly imagine that theQing dynasty would conquer China but in fact it is theQing that would come and conquer all of China and not only that but if you look at most of human history this pattern repeats itself if you look at a region the strongest nation does not come out on top it's usually the weakest most marginalized area that will eventually come and conquer the entire territory and create an empire okay so clearly the way that we understand history it's problematic it's wrong so what I want to what I want to do is propose to you a new way to understand how empires come into being okay and this was actually first proposed by um a Muslim scholar historian named Ibin Kudan okay and he proposed the idea of aasayiah and all this word means is basically cohesion or group solidarity his theory is that yes the people in the margins they're poorer but because they're poorer they're more unified they are more they focus more on solidarity on working together whereas in the rich areas they become too individualistic they become too decent too corrupt and ultimately that's why it's always these tribes from the margins that actually conquer the wealthy civilized areas okay and this is a pattern that repeat repeats itself throughout human history all the time so it's almost like an iron law of history so what I want to do is show you that there actually three metrics that you can use to measure how dynamic a society is and how likely it is to triumph in the end okay these three metrics are energy openness and cohesion okay cohesion just follows the idea of aayiah which is just to say how likely is it that these people are willing to work together do they see themselves as a team are they willing to sacrifice themselves for each other are they a family okay so that's the idea of cohesion openness is a very important concept and openness just means how willing are you willing to adapt how willing are you wi how much are you willing to accept your limitations and be resilient okay so you you can think of openness as um humility as resilience energy just means that you're willing to work hard you're focused you have a clear goal and you're motivated to achieve this goal okay so these three metrics tell us how dynamic society is going to be and using these three metrics we can now better understand why that theQing dynasty was able to conquer all of China okay so the idea is that if you're rich okay you're rich okay what happens often is that you have low energy and what this means is that the elite don't want to work anymore they rather just exploit the other people okay the people and because the people are being enslaved they're too much in debt they have low energy as well for them it's not really about building a great nation it's not really about doing a great job it's just about getting by okay so and then the idea of openness is that the elite become extremely corrupt they become very insulated they become very arrogant and so they refuse to admit that they're wrong and as a result society becomes snack stagnant it doesn't really improve and the idea of cohesion is that because of wealth inequality because of corruption people are much more individualized people are much more animized okay and this allows for a uh new group to come in and conquer everyone okay does that make sense guys all right so um I'm going to use sorry I'm going to use actually um another example okay an example is the Greek city states and remember the Greek city states it's really the height of human civilization they gave us Homer Plato Fidities uh Sophocles okay just basically the basis for all of western civilization now what's interesting is that for most of the of their history the Greek city states and these are basically like this small small cities okay there are thousand of them and and on average they're about a thousand people each there are some big city states like Athens but even Athens is not that big so at its height Athens had about 50,000 people okay so these city states like Athens thieves um Sparta okay these are the major ones and there are other Korean argos they're always in competition with each other very much like the Chinese waring states as well and again if we look at the year 500 BCE you would think that maybe Athens or Sparta would emerge as the grand unifier of the Greek city states and in fact what happened was that Athens did become an empire but then the other Greek the other Greek city states start to attack Athens and Athens declined over time okay and the advantage that Athens had over everyone else was just tremendous first of all Athens had the greatest navy okay as you can see uh the AGN is primarily about who controls the seas so a so was able to control the trade routes in the um Aian therefore it's the wealthiest city state it have the greatest population has the most innovation it has the most strategic location it has most most wealth so you would just assume that Athens would come to conquer all the Greedy states but in fact it was the Macedonians okay who came in and conquered all the city states and at this time in history you couldn't possibly imagine that because the Macedonians were poor they were isolated they were not all cultured they were univilized okay but again they had energy openness and cohesion and that allowed them to conquer the citystates what's most what's amazing is that even after this area was unified okay the Maconians would then do the impossible and go over and conquer the great Persian Empire the first great empire in human history it was huge it was Egypt Anatolia Mesopotamia the Zagos malt mountains Persia it was everywhere and in a very quick amount of time the Macedonians under the Great they sailed across the Aian landed a small fort and then very quickly in about 10 years time conquered the entire Persian Empire and at this point in history is you would think that the Persian Empire sorry you would think that the new national empire would be invincible but then what happened a few decades later is the rise of the Romans who are the Romans well at this time in history we don't know who they are okay um uh Rome is probably here somewhere okay but as you can see the entire Italian peninsula is being colonized by the Greeks and then the Romans who are you know these poor backward tribal people eventually over time they will conquer the entire Italian peninsula and they're going to go and conquer the Greek u mainland and then go go south to conquer uh Carthage as well and they will create the Roman Empire okay so this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout human history the empire becomes corrupt lazy arrogant this and this gives opportunity for a troubled people whether it's a Macedonians whether it's aqing whether it's a Romans to come and conquer all of them okay but now the question then is okay if that's true um and so let's look at more examples okay of this let's look at the Aztecs and the Aztecs is even a more stark example so this is this is about the 16th century 15th century okay as you can see um the Mexican peninsula it's it is divided into different waring city states okay very similar situation to the Greek city states and the Chinese city states then what's happen is the Aztecs we are going to come in from the north okay and the Aztecs are um a poor tribe that's starving okay so they're basically from uh North America they come in because they're looking for food and they're warrior people so they're hired by other city states to fight for them eventually they become too powerful so they become isolated onto a marsh okay and this marsh it's poor and everyone just put them just assumed that they would starve to death in this marsh what's amazing is that as a people they became very creative and they turn this marsh into farmland and over time they will slowly come to conquer everyone okay and they establish the Aztec Empire which rules over millions and millions and then what happens which is one of the greatest mysteries in human history is you have another group of people called the concquisidors from Spain and there's only about 500 of them okay arriving about the year 195 1519 they come in and in like a very short amount of time they conquer the entire Aztec Empire and Spain comes to rule basically all of South and Latin America okay so even though yes we have a formula in place whichever group has the most energy whichever group is the most open the most cohesive will conquer the other groups it still doesn't explain to us how this happened how this guy uh Hernandez with 500 conquisttors was able to come in and conquer a land uh of millions and millions okay now there are historical explanations including of course disease uh people from Spain had diseases and the Aztecs were not did not have the immune system to counter uh these these diseases another explanation is um the Aztecs believed that these conquesters were gods and that's why they surrendered very quickly another explanation is that the conquesttors had allies local allies that were pissed off at the Aztecs but again these explanations they sound okay they sound like they work but they don't actually give us the full picture of what really happened and in game theory what we're really trying to figure out is what happened exactly okay it's a game how are the players um playing the game what are their motivations what are their incentives okay does it make sense okay that's that's what we're trying to figure out what actually happened in this instance uh I want to look at one more example before we look into the theory of game in in game theory okay this is one of the early civilizations in human history okay in fact um it's considered the first great civilization of human history it is the Samrians and what happened was that um you look at a world map okay this is a world map right mesopotamia is a center of the world because you want to access the rest of the world you have to go through Mesopotamia and if you look at Mesopotamia the center of Mesopotenia is a place called Uric okay sorry u okay which is here okay as you can see Uric is the meeting place of the Euphrates and the Tigris and if you look at this the URI uh allows you to access uh the Persian Gulf which gives you access to India okay or we call the IBC the Indis Valley civilization and then um and then you allow and then traders are able to take the goods and cross to Egypt okay and then you're able to go north to Anatolia so why did Europe become the first great world city because it was a center of all global trade so different people came together into the city in order to establish a trading post okay and over time it grew and it grew and grew because it was very wealthy okay and over time um it colonies elsewhere okay so it's up colonies in other places and then eventually these different city states came into conflict with with with each other which is the same process as what happened with the Chinese waring states as well as the Greek city states and you would assume that one of these city states would conquer the rest but in fact again it was these tribal mercenaries uh from an isolated region called the Acadians the Aadians who would come and conquer everyone else okay and the Acadians okay and after after they they built the first empire okay then what happened is that other people come over and conquer them as well and then you had people from the Zagos mountains the Persians basically come in and unify the entire area and create the Persian Empire all right so this is a pattern that emerges throughout human history it's a pretty consistent pattern okay we have theories as to why this is happening yes we do know that groups that are energetic open and cohesive are will triumph over other groups but the idea of game theory is to figure out exactly what happened okay so let's go over exactly what happened and I I will show you that what's happening is that as nations rise and fall the games they play changes okay does that make sense the game changes and therefore their motivations their incentives their strategies change over time all right okay so um are are we clear about the history here all right okay all right so in the beginning okay game theory game okay rise okay in the beginning you as a people need to come together and build a land in which you can all prosper or at least have food to eat okay therefore the game is cooperation and the mechanism cooperation actually religion so in this first game okay what you're trying to do is you're trying to create a dynamic religion that motivates people to be energetic to give them reason to work really hard okay and the people who are best able to articulate this religion become the elite okay and this includes poets and priests all right poets and priests and at this point in history it's basically a startup okay everyone's enthusiastic everyone's working hard everyone feels as though they're making a positive contribution to the world but over time what happens is that the elite okay become hereditary the game becomes how do I the elite pass on my privileges to my children okay and and the way they do that is by changing the religion okay the religion now becomes almost like a bureaucracy so in the first game the religion is about energy it's about creativity it's about working together okay but then in the second iteration the the religion becomes like a bureaucracy which is like you must follow the rules of the game okay the rules of the game are set there's a hierarchy and you must obey this hierarchy okay now then what happens is a process called elite overp production okay the idea of late over production is that yes these privileges are being passed on to the children but now over time they have there are too many children and so what happens is that society breaks up into different factions okay and usually what happens is that these factions are divided according to the princes okay so if there are four princes okay who are about to inherit the throne there are four different factions that support them that does that does not mean the prince is the leader of the faction it just means that the prince is the symbol of a faction okay all right and at this time in history the way that they reduce the conflict is is the losing factions what what they do is they move away okay they're exile okay and then they have to set up a new colony and this is a process that continues where the losers of the game are forced into exile until there's no more place to colonize okay and now you have the waring states period okay the waring states period and in fact what's interesting is that the waring states period is a time of maximum creativity for a civilization why is the idea of open cooperative competition okay so back to theQing back to the Greeks uh the um Samrians there are different colonies okay and they're all competing against each other and so you need to be open and innovative if if you're triumph okay at the same time they're trading with each other so they're sharing best practices they're sharing innovations with each other okay so this leads to the idea of open competition which again marks the height of the civilization so guess what guys China's been around for 5,000 years but most of the invasions happened when it happened during the waring states period 100 years when we had k confusious mons uh la it's basically everyone okay all right and and if you just look at um other civilizations it's the same for other civilizations as well where if you look at the Greeks um during the classical period they basically created everything that becomes the foundation for western civilization okay does that make sense all right now what's interesting is what happens next eventually what happens is these city states figure out that you know what yes the game is we compete against each other but we can also choose to work together okay how do you work together by intermarriage okay intermarriage and the idea of intermarriage creates the idea of equilibrium and at this point in history warfare becomes organized warfare okay so remember uh before warfare was about innovation but now when these elites from different city states when they intermar with each other okay they have a new equilibrium so they are above the above the state now okay does it make sense guys all right so now when they fight it's not really about fighting each other it's about reducing their population to maintain control okay it's a way to resolve the elite o over production issue we have too many people struggling for too many status positions and the way you do that is through population control okay so warfare becomes a mechanism of population control all right so even though these city states are still in theory competing against each other they essentially now have reach an equilibrium and equilibrium a no for equilibrium is basically they have empire okay all right so now the game changes before during the war states period it was a game to see which state would be the best the most innovative and that's why you invite people who um could contribute the most to your city state okay that's that's why you were meritocracy you only pro promoted the best and the brightest once you reach an equilibrium you don't have to do that okay all you have to do is just maintain the status quo and so what happens is you create this rigid hierarchy and what matters is who reaches the top office hierarchy and as a result you create court politics right court politics or factional struggle factions okay does it make sense guys all right so if you look at any court politics the faction that triumphs is the one that's able to solve three problems okay three problems these three problems are secrecy trust and coordination remember in theory everyone has to obey the bureaucracy right but if you just play by the rules of the game you're going to lose so what you want to do is you want to cheat in the game the way But if you want to cheat in the game you have to do so secretly okay you have to do secretly but if you do so secretly that creates a problem of like how do you trust each other if you don't if you and if you if you're doing it all in secret the problem is like how do you coordinate how do you move together right because you you can't have meetings where you take notes because if you're discovered you'll all be executed by the other factions okay so historically the way we resolve this issue is through the idea of secret societies okay so um let's figure out how secret societies work and this is true for China this is true for the Greeks this is true for the Aztecs this is true for everyone okay but like there's certain um aspects of secret societies okay the first is idea of secrecy okay how do you do that well you do that through the idea of a hierarchy okay hierarchy or compment comprementalization and so there are different so within single societies there's a hierarchy as well where only have people at the very top know what's going on and if you want to join you initiate it but you have put at the bottom okay and slowly you climb the ladder okay and this is to maintain secrecy trust how do you get people to trust each other well you get people to trust each other through the idea of transgression okay so if we cheat on attached together we are much more likely to trust each other doesn't make sense because if you're caught you you you all get punished okay so by bringing the law together we can trust each other okay and the most basic type of um transgression is the idea of ritual sacrifice okay and the idea of ritual sacrifice is you basically decide to go kill someone together okay you capture that person then for some um uh ritual you then kill that person okay doesn't make sense and then to solve the problem of coordination you have the idea of esquetology esquetology is just mythology all right like why are you guys doing what you're doing okay and the answer often is because we're trying to serve a higher god that wants to conquer the world and we are his servants in this quest to conquer the world and end the world to make it a paradise okay so different suicides have different esquetologies but the system is the same okay doesn't make sense okay and what happens is and this is like really important guys every faction has to form their own secret society and now the game of empire becomes one of a struggle between different secret societies does it make sense meaning what meaning you don't care what happens to the empire you don't care about the enemies of the empire all you care about that you your team emerges on top of the game okay and so what does that mean it means that you become sorry insular all right okay you become insular you also become corrupt okay because you need resources to play this game so what you do is you steal from the people okay it's all it's all about trying to steal as much as you can in order to feed your faction you become insular you become corrupt okay um and then divided okay do you understand this is what happens because of different factions within the empire or the equilibrium they become insular they become corrupt and they become uh divided okay which is why they ultimately lose to these struggle factions because the opposite of insular of course is open the the um the opposite of corrupt is energetic and the opposite of divided is of course cohesive cohesion okay okay now we understand why ultimately the borderlands the tribes and borderlands are able to conquer the empire or the equilibrium okay does that make sense guys all right but there's actually more to this okay the and so what happens is that you have the different factions okay societies fighting against each other and again from their perspective all they care about is winning against the other factions so what do they do what they do is they invite other foreigners to come help them hey do you understand okay so these are what are called mercenaries all right and these mercenaries come into them and their leadership is absorbed into the societies through um esquetology through transgression through hierarchy okay all right so this is what happens these mercenaries actually invited in okay and and and like but there's always contact okay kind of through trade banditry mercenary okay doesn't make sense because these people these in the regions they're so poor they'll do anything to survive so they'll trade of you but they also steal from you and they also come and fight for you okay what's important is that through trade they're becoming wealthier through benetry they're becoming wealthier as well and by become by working as your mercenaries they're de they are learning your best technology your best fighting skills your best weapons okay right and then what happens is that the mercenaries eventually take over okay at first they merge but then the mercenaries just kill everyone and then take over and that's how what happens that's why theQing were able to conquer the waring states okay they don't teach you this in history class but according to game theory what happened was that different factions of these different states actually inviting just basically conquered one by one by one does that make sense same thing with the Macedonians right the master came in and helped one city state then they call one city state and move on to the next okay but it was always a certain part of that city state a certain faction of that city state which invite the mark is in the first place okay doesn't make sense and this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout human history okay so if you want to know what's going to happen today what's going to happen tomorrow just figure out which areas of the world are the most energetic most open and most cohesive and then figure out which empires are the most corrupt most insular and the most divided okay and then you'll figure out who will conquer who all right does that make sense guys all right so I'm going to give you two more examples to better illustrate how this works all right so when I was in high school in Canada we played a game called the world game and in this game it's very simple okay you're you're put into a team of maybe four or five players okay and then each team is assigned a country like maybe USA Britain uh India Pakistan Japan and then each team is given an envelope okay and then with within this envelope you're given certain resources okay so basically you know paper scissors ruler okay and then there's there's an or organization called the World Bank and what you're trying to do is you're trying to become the wealthiest country in the world the way you do that is you take your resources and you turn it into commodities that the World Bank buys from you okay okay so maybe like triangles and circles and squares okay but to create these commodities you need resources right you need scissors you need rulers you need paper you need glue okay but different countries will have different resource resources so United States has everything okay and Pakistan is interesting because Pakistan usually gets nothing okay there are no resources but you're allowed to trade with each other right okay you're allowed to trade with each other okay so even though you have nothing you can go to United States and beg and say "Oh oh can I please borrow your ruler for for today?" Okay you go to Britain says "Hey can I can I borrow your paper for today?" Okay or "Hey I'll come work for you for free." Right you can trade and so you play this for for one day and it's really interesting what happens okay usually what happen I'm not saying all the time but I've seen this happen a lot at the end of the day you you look at who are the wealthiest countries in the world what happens is well the United States becomes number one okay why because United States just has everything in the world it is the wealthiest country in the world it has too much resources okay but number two is interesting you would think it would be Japan and Britain but it's actually Pakistan okay the country that starts out with nothing at all why because they're forced to be the most energetic the most open and most cohesive team members have to go and beg to work for free okay other team members go and lie and cheat and steal okay they're forced to be resourceful and creative okay the world game and that's how the world works guys just because you have the most resources just because you have the most people does not mean you'll win the game at the end what matters is how energetic your people are how open they are how resourceful they are that's what matters okay and often they are open energetic and cohesive because they're poor all right it's that simple pakistan has nothing so they're they're forced to be creative poverty leads to creativity okay another thing this is that if I were to surmise the future I would say right now in in East Asia I would think that North Korea has a better future than China okay just based on history and it would be like that's impossible north Korea can feed its own people well I understand that but if you know game theory okay and you understand the principles that we've learned today then you're forced to conclude that in East Asia North Korea has a better future than China because ultimately it's about how open energetic and cohesive the people are as opposed to how rich and powerful you are okay does that make sense i will also point out another example okay so before teaching in high school I was teaching uh teachers how to teach STEM okay state STEM education and I usually run two-day workshops and what I would do is I go into a school and I divide the faculty the teachers into teams okay like teams of like four or five there'd be like 10 teams okay there'd be a lot of teachers and the way I teach is I would give them an assignment and I I I would give them resources and I and it would be a competition okay so for example let's look at which team can build the fastest car okay toy car let's look at let's look at which team can build um the best airplane uh let's look at which team can build a catapult okay so so I would give them some resources i give them the assignment and then they would work on a whole day okay now what's interesting is at the end of the first day you would have I would rank the teams okay and then number two and then day two we would start the competition again with a new assignment on day two which team would finish first do you guys know so after day one all 10 teams are ranked according to their success okay so team one has the best 10 team team 10 has the worst what happened the second day can you guys guess i think team 10 wins yeah okay according to game theory what happens is team 10 wins and this this exactly what happens the results are reversed okay number 10 shoots up to number one and then number one falls all the way down this is what happens a lot it's it's actually common sense if you think about it right if you're the best student in the school you never have to reflect you never have to like think about how to improve because you're always number one so you become arrogant you become complacent so after you graduate from school what happens you can't find any work because people find you too arrogant you refuse to learn you want to be the boss you want people to just listen to you okay but if you're the worst student in a school you're used to being laughed at you're used to um constantly adapting okay so when you go into the workplace you are much more likely to uh learn you're much more likely to focus on relationships okay so in China China there's a joke right in school there are two people that everyone hates okay the best student and the worst student why do you hate the best student because the best student is going to graduate and come back as your principal one day why do you hate the worst student because he's going to graduate and come back and give you a lecture on how to become rich okay that's why in China everyone hates the best student and the worst student and these are and these are two students who will probably be the most successful okay especially the worst student because the worst student regardless of all his problems he's openminded he's willing to work hard and he's willing to help build teams and make make sacrifices so that others become his friend okay right um uh yeah we have a question um so like for example for this case in day two the team 10 becomes the first one and the first team becomes the last but will the like will the previously the first team been forced to be open and to be energetic and then be number one again on the third day that is a great question thank you for asking it okay so in my experience this is what happens okay what happens is that if what happens if we keep on going right what happens in day three day team team day day three day four okay this this this what happens team one really screws up on day two right they finish first in day one day two they screw up day three and day four they continue to screw up why because they don't know what they did wrong and they refuse to um reflect do you understand okay so we see this in history where an empire once it rises it falls it never comes back it never comes back do you understand it never rise up up again now it's possible that new people come in and use the name of the empire okay but it's not the same people anymore it's a different team so that's a danger of being number one once you're number one you become so arrogant that it's that impossible for you to be humble again okay um team two we go down okay so it's very unlikely that you have a system where okay uh team one they fall but then they reflect and become number one again okay it doesn't work that way when societies fall they just die off okay it's possible a new group comes and pretends to be them but they're actually a different people and and that's just way that humans work okay does that make sense yes okay yep so on the third day the team 10 will become the second last group because they fall and the n the group nine will be the first one is that the cycle that will go on um yeah so I' I've never run a day three so I can't say for sure okay but but that that's what should happen okay all right that's what should happen where yes team 10 will fall off and a new team will come into place okay all right and if you look at history that's just the way it is again we don't have an example of where an empire fell but then the people decide to like change their um their uh mentality and then they become the best again okay so in the future if you if we apply this theory there should be three countries that will emerge as great empires in our history okay Germany why because they lost World War I and lost World War II does that make sense guys they were never an empire they were never a world empire so Germany according to this theory will one day come to rule the world or at least Europe and Asia okay and if you if you actually look at their history what happened in World War I World War II they lost millions of people okay so Germany will will be one day a great empire i'm pretty sure of it actually and then there's another country that would be a great empire and that is Japan because Japan lost World War II they were never a great empire so Japan should come to dominate East Asia according his theory remember the Americans dropped two nukes on Japan right and also look at World War II the Americans destroyed Japan with firebombing they the Americans killed more fire bombing than actually did with the nukes okay but Japan was destroyed it was humiliated and and now you go to Japan you can see how energetic people are right you can see how open they are and you can see how cohesive they are you understand because Japan was destroyed in World War II it's something that force them to reflect as a people and now they want vengeance basically all right and the last country of course is Israel right because Israel the people in Israel believe that for thousands of years they were persecuted by other people okay so these are three great empires that we we will move towards in our history germans Japan uh uh Japanese and the Israelis okay does that make sense mhm all right the Americans are done how about China done okay all right look look guys guys i mean like like this is all just a theory okay but all I'm saying is look around you and ask yourself are the people here open-minded are they willing to learn from their mistakes do they ever say I'm wrong are people energetic do do they take their work very seriously if I give people an assignment will they work really hard to make sure it's done well do people feel as though they're all part of one big group are are they willing to make sacrifices for each other okay Japan is okay that's all I'm saying and maybe even the North Koreans are all right does that make sense guys and again it's all just a theory all right I I'm just proposing to you a theory of how to understand the world but what's actually going to happen I can't actually tell you right but according to this theory um Germany and Japan and Israel will be the three great nations any more questions guys yeah c can you can you Oh yeah but like for example the uh Japan that it did didn't have that much sources so how could they succeed i I keep on telling you guys you don't need resources you can cheat you can steal you can beg all right okay does that make sense okay like like if you just go back to the world game um whichever team starts off with the least resources are often the most creative okay when I mean creative they'll just like go and like lie to people says you know like I'll come work to you for free but then you'll steal some some resources yourself okay all right because they have actually no choice in the matter right uh yeah yeah so I have a little questions like uh you you say that those who are poorest and like in the most dangerous positions always have the most energy and cohesions to succeed but I I think eventually All right so so so so okay let me be precise okay yeah just because you're poor does not mean you're open energetic and cohesive okay does not mean that but if you want to go from being poor to becoming rich you have to be open energetic and cohesive does that make sense yeah so because in Africa they're poor but doesn't mean they're open energetic and cohesive yeah so so my question is like after they become successful and they are eventually re rich I think like like all society they may fall as like be when they reach the their their their higher state right yes yes yeah and so my question is uh like you you say that like the J Japan or Germany will eventually become the like the leader of the of the of their like regions regions but like I I understand that after World War II the Japan and German really develop very fast but like now they are all wealthy societies and also They're young the youngesters the young the the new like people in their country forget about the war and they well when they born they born in the wealthy and like happy happy societies so how can you make sure that the the society those society will continue to cohesions and developed but not like just to fail like other rich societies okay you know that's a great question that's a great point okay you're absolutely right because after World War II uh Japan and Germany become very wealthy so if they become very wealthy then in theory shouldn't they become also corrupt insular and arrogant and the answer is no okay and there's good reason why because ultimately power means that you're able to impose your game on other people you're able to make other people play your game and therefore you're able to extract rent from other people okay and that's what and that's what these secret sides are fighting for they're fighting for power who becomes the game master the problem with Japan and Germany is yes became very wealthy but the game master was America and ultimately America decided that their money belongs to me okay so an example of this is something called the plastic courts okay plac courts basically the plastic court just meant that um Japan was was becoming too wealthy america got very annoyed so America said to Japan I want you to destroy your economy and Japan's like how america says just say says I want you to spend too much money i want you people to stop saving money and start spending money go overseas and buy whatever crap you want okay do you understand so in theory it seemed as though Japan got rich but Japan got rich but it never had any power it it it could not be a sovereign nation okay power means that you're able to impose your will on other people same with Germany where yes Germany became very wealthy but all that money went where it went to America right same with Japan japan all that money went to America h how because they were forced to buy US treasury bonds okay and then America could do stuff to you for example um America could force Japan to sign a plastic cord and force Japan to destroy its own economy and America could also destroy Germany's pipeline North Street and there's nothing Germany can do about it okay in fact the German economy has been destroyed right now because Germany is a vassal state to America so when um Russia invaded Ukraine America just basically said to Germany you can no longer do business deals with Russia but before Germany required Russian oil and energy to fuel its economy okay america also said to Germany you can you can no longer trade with China but before most of uh German car exports were going to China right yeah and because Germany was forced out of the China market China was able to develop its own manufacturing industry okay does that make sense so it seems as though Germany and Japan become very wealthy they were not they they were just vast states to America okay does that make sense yeah so I have a Yeah yeah yeah uh so like you said that only those society who are very poor but they want to they have the ability to co to to cohisions and be energetic and they can they can like eventually become the ruler of the regions but what decide a society or a poor society to become energetic cohesions or not like why Japan or German uh have that energy but like those other countries that may also like be defeated on in the war or is very poor uh cannot yeah that's a great question yeah so the answer the obvious answer is a leader okay so you look at the Mongols right the Mongols uh before the emergence of of gang of Khan the Mongols were almost like a vassal state right because the Mongols were divided they were poor um they they were willing to do whatever it took to survive and so um they became mercenaries to the Song they became mercenaries to other groups as well okay but then emerg to unify everyone and once he was able to unify everyone the Mongols were very quickly able to destroy everyone else okay so it's usually a great leader but leader doesn't necessarily mean a general it could also mean a poet right so someone like Homer or a great thinker to give you a new religion okay so for example the person had someone called Zorah which who we studied last semester okay even Jesus okay but it's someone to come in to say that we are a people and it could be a poet it could be um a general it could be a um prophet a priest doesn't matter okay but that one person then unifies the imagination of everyone into one cohesive group okay does that make sense okay but that's a great question thank you okay and that's why some certain groups uh are able to um cohhere together and other groups are not because one um person is able to merge and you know that's why okay we'll talk about this later on but that's why the world is the way it is why do we have organizations like the United Nations why do we have international development aid the goal guys is to identify the possibility of a leader emerging and make sure he does not emerge you understand okay if you left Africa alone Africa will be a lot better but because you have all these schools all these NOS's all these organizations in Africa what they're really doing is ensuring that Africa is in a continuous state of development okay if you just left them alone they might starve but at the same time a great deal might emerge to unite all of them you understand okay but we'll talk about this next class how the American Empire controls the world
