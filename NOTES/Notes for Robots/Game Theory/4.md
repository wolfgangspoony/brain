today we will look at immigration who wins the game of immigration and who loses why do they win why do they lose okay so let's look at the United States which is where most immigrants go and as you can see from this chart there are certain ethnic groups that do better than other ethnic groups so um the Indian people make the most money in America and this makes sense because um India has a very competitive college system where only the best and brightest get into their technical institutes and then after college they go United States to do graduate work then they go on to Silicon Valley to become uh engineers some become doctors but Indians as a demographic are very successful then um you have the other Asian groups so Japanese Korean Filipino Chinese also do very well uh East Asians do very well in school and East Asians are known for being very hard workers the white people are the majority and they are the average okay and they make about 70,000 US a year this is um just average income but then what's troubling is that as you go lower you find that there are certain ethnic groups that don't do well economically they include of course um Mexicans Latinos as well as black Americans who traditionally have been slaves in America so the question for us today is that why is it that there are certain ethnic groups specifically East Asian groups that uh do well economically and then you have other ethnic groups specifically Latinos and blacks who do not do well economically okay so the traditional explanation is that it's just that certain cultures prize education more than other cultures in fact some extremists will go on to say that genetically East Asians are just smarter than everyone else okay so this is the PISA rankings this is from 2018 the pieces is um the program for international student assessment so every three years the OECD which is which is international organization around the world they organize tests for 14 year olds in three subjects math science and reading and based on these results the OCD which is primarily concerned with economic development forecast a nation's ability to do well economically in the next 10 20 30 years as you can see from this map there are certain countries that do outstanding on the pizza the nations in green do really well uh the nations in yellow are average and then there are these red nations that are below average meaning that they will suffer economically now as you can see the nations that do really well are actually based primarily in East Asia and they are Japan South Korea Vietnam China that's why a lot of people believe that in the future East Asia will come to dominate the world economically in fact there are many who believe that already East Asia dominates the world economically especially China then you have these other nations in red that uh will suffer economically uh you have Latin and South America who traditionally have not have not done very well on the pizza you also have Africa and the Middle East that suffers um on a pizza and then you have Indonesia Malaysia these countries that don't do well on the pizza the nations in are gray by the way are nations that are are that have don't have the development in order to actually have students take tests okay they don't have the infrastructure the logistics to actually have students take tests and so what you can see about the nations in red is first of all they're primarily based in a region okay Latin and South America but also you can actually group them also by religion okay Islam okay Muslims don't do well on the pizza and that's why there's great fear that uh Islamic countries will fall behind economically also So another concern is immigration so what's been happening is that um immigrants from Latin South America have been moving to United States and Islamic um um nations the people have been moving to Europe okay now a lot of this this immigration is driven by war so nations like Libya Syria Afghanistan Iraq have seen them have seen the themselves destroyed because America's war on terror forcing millions of refugees to seek better opportunities in Europe okay and so this is causing a lot of conflict because on one hand um these immigrants don't do well economically um on the other hand they're moving to these very wealthy nations and that's causing a lot of conflict so what's driving this conflict okay so again from the pizza rankings it seems as though East Asians will come to dominate the world the problem is that when you actually look at American society and you look at who succeeds it turns out East Asians don't do as well as you think they do well if East Asians are the best students in school and they go on to the most prestigious colleges and they are the smartest with the highest IQ you would think they would come to dominate American society but that's not true actually so um this is a chart of new CEOs and what this means is that from about 2000 Americans corporations they tried their best to bring in more diversity into the corporate boardroom okay traditionally CEOs American corporations have been white middle-aged uh and men so they're trying to diversify the leadership of American corporations and it turns out that white women okay have done the best white women have been the most successful in climbing the corporate ladder in America um what's interesting now then is that Latino and African-American men okay they do okay not great but they do okay and who is underperforming are East Asian men okay you can see this from this map where the growth in East Asian man it's pretty steady now there are different reasons for this okay one reason is just that um there's something called DEI DEI in America diversity equity inclusion and the idea of DEI is to uh redress historical wrongs and one historical wrong is the fact that women minorities have been discriminated against in American society and therefore they should be given better opportunities more opportunities to succeed okay so um you can argue that because of DEI East Asian men have been discriminated against because historically people believe that East Asian men have not been discriminated against even though that's not that's not correct okay so you can argue it's really DEI but another way of understanding this is figure out who succeeds in corporate America and the answer is if you look at the qualities of successful uh CEOs well first of all they tend to be aggressive okay or assertive okay another saying this is that they have high risk tolerance or they take chances um also to navigate corporations you need high EQ okay emotional intelligence empathy uh or collaboration skills okay um so these are the skills you need in order to do well in American corporations and unfortunately these certain skills um the the uh stereotype is that East Asian men don't actually have these skills as Asian men are tend to be much more individualistic they're they tend to be um more cautious and they tend not to speak a lot okay um so East Asian men are not known for being articulate which is something that you need in order to do well in a corporate boardroom where there's a lot of debate where there's a lot of argumentation where where you have to present your view your opinion very coherently okay so what's interesting is that the skills that you need to do well in the corporate boardroom um East Asian men don't have and you can also argue that it's because East Asian men don't have these skills they have other skills that allows them to do well in school for example East Asian men are more focused they're more unitarian they're uh grave obsessed they are um more uh compliant more obedient okay they like listening to authority and that's why they do well in school but what this means ultimately is a situation in which even though East Asian men do well economically and they do well academically their status okay status in America is not as great as their income would suggest in fact you could make the argument that East Asian men are among um the groups that have the lowest status in America which makes no sense but again unfortunately the evidence bears us out especially okay the dating market okay so again remember what is it that men want to do well they want to obtain status so that they can find the most attractive mate okay so um we're going to now look at statistics from dating websites okay online dating websites this is from Okay Cupid okay okay uh which is one of the more popular um dating websites in the United States and so we have a lot of statistics about how people behave online so look at this guys okay if you are an Asian female and a Asian man gets in touch with you about 22% of these Asian female will respond to an inquiry a first message if the person is an Asian man but what's interesting is that if it's more white guy then there's more interest 29% that's a pretty significant difference okay so this is just a first reply now what's interesting is that um if you're an Asian uh male okay what's interesting is that people are less likely to respond to you okay so this is another map that shows us stat statistics from the uh dating website okay so this is um white woman okay let's look at white woman and there and how interested they are in other ethnicities if you are white okay Caucasian they're very interested in fact they're the most interested if you're black they're not as interested okay if you're Hispanic they're not interested but look at this if you're Asian they are least interested okay that's interesting um but look at this if you are an Asian woman okay you're pretty interested in white guys you're most interested in Asian guys okay and you're similarly interested in black and Hispanic guys so it seems that in the dating market one group that is most discriminated against are ease Asian men okay another group um that's also discriminated against heavily are black women okay all right okay so if you if you look at marriage patterns there's also discriminate discrimination against East Asian men okay so 20% of East Asian women will marry white guys okay so if you are an East Asian woman you are attracted to white guys and you're attracted to East Asian guys primarily but if you are an East Asian men okay all right here you're not that attractive to white women okay so 20% of East Asian women will marry a white person but only 9% or 10% of Asian men will marry a white woman so this leads to a disparity in the marriage market and what this means is that uh for East Asian men under 25 years old 75% are single meaning they cannot find a date or a partner okay okay so this leads to a very very stark conclusion for East Asian men the reality is that if you're an East Asian man in America people don't find you that attractive okay so they did a lot of studies about the East uh about the dating market in America and the radical conclusion that they have is that is this okay a white woman okay is more attracted to a white man than an Asian man and how do we know this statistically a if a white man makes $62,000 a year for the Asian man to be as attractive to her the man the Asian man needs to make $300,000 a year that's a huge huge difference in other words a white woman will be attracted to the average white guy and she will only be interested in the highest earning Asian guys okay but not not only are they making a lot but these Asian guys are actually at the top of their fields because $200,000 in America is actually a lot of money okay so you have to be a surgeon you have to be a top lawyer you have to be an entrepreneur in order to be attractive to just the average white woman not even the the most attractive white woman so this is actually a pretty stark situation for Asian men and so you have a really strange situation where Asian men East Asian men did everything right they they did exactly what they were supposed to do they went to school worked hard in school got the best grades then worked hard at their jobs and got and did very well in their jobs but now two things have happened because they follow the rules because they living right they didn't commit any crime they're not on welfare they pay taxes they're they can contribute to community but because of this two things have happened one is that they're not able to climb into status positions in America they're not CEOs the other thing is that they have problems finding a very good mate okay it's easy for them to find someone off their status or below but it's very hard for East Asian man to actually marry up and improve their status and social economic standing in America all right all right so this leads us to a very very stark uh disparity right so let's look at this guys you have East Asian men and here's how they play the game of immigration uh they do well in school okay they have good jobs employment yes they have uh they're not on welfare okay they don't go to jail okay and then you look at um other minorities okay specifically Hispanic black and um Muslim okay well they don't do as well in school okay they don't do they don't make as much as ease Asian man uh they're more likely to be on welfare and they're more likely to go in jail okay all right so you would think that East Asian men will ultimately triumph in the end but what is really disconcerting is that according to game theory East Asian men are playing the game wrong whereas these other groups these um Hispanics these blacks these Muslim groups they are much more likely to win the game okay so how can we explain this and the explanation is actually pretty straightforward but it's actually very disconcerting or very disturbing the the answer is if someone invites you to play his game don't agree to play by the rules because the game is out so that you will lose otherwise why would he invite you think of a casino right a casino is like please come in and play our game do you think a casino is fair if the casino was were fair the casino will go bankrupt right the casino is set up so that you have to lose otherwise they go out of business the same thing with immigration if a nation like United States is inviting you into their nation and you play by their rules you will always lose okay and this is what's happening to East Asian men where they go to the United States they play by the rules and they'll never climb into sus positions and their woman will be married off to white men the most attractive of all Asian women will be married off to white guys whereas East Asian guys will make their money and then stay at home and play video games all the time okay the game is rigged so the only logical strategy according to game theory to this situation is to break the game cheat okay and that's what the other minorities are doing and how do you do that well you don't play the game you don't go to you don't go to school and obey the teacher okay what how to win is by sticking together and having lots of babies and over time that will enable you to win the game because of demographics okay does that make sense you're much better off not going to school being poor but staying together being cohesive and having lots of babies rather than going to school getting a good job doing everything you've been told to do because ultimately your energy will be stolen from you because of the rules of the game okay does that make sense guys all right all right so okay so again immigration is very important because all in the world poor people are going to rich countries to seek better opportunities right so it's really um North America primarily United States Canada the United States then you have um Australia um New Zealand and Europe okay and countries that are going to these place places are China East Asia basically um and you have the um Latinos the Africans uh Middle East okay all right and again you have situation where East Asians are much more likely to go and conform but then you have other groups that go and refuse to conform and as I mentioned from a game theory perspective it is better in the long term for you as a person not to conform not to play the rules of the game than to actually play by the rules of the game i know it sounds weird okay but according to game theory that's the best outcome for you all right so um an example is in Europe okay in Europe they have a huge Muslim problem these Muslims are less likely to integrate uh they don't do very well in school but they will claim welfare they will have lots and lots of babies which is a drain on the uh economy of these nations and what this means is that in the year uh 2050 okay in the year 2050 this is what's going to happen in Sweden of the population will be Muslim in the UK 17% in France 17% in Germany 11% the in Italy it'll be 12% okay so it seems as though there's a population replacement going on but not only that but because Muslims are much more likely to have more children than Europeans the populations that are Muslim will be younger more energetic whereas the Europeans will be much more old they'll likely be retired so if this trend continues then Europe will eventually be taken over by the Muslim minority okay and so the Muslims they don't do well in school and they don't make that much money but look at their advantages okay first of all they are cohesive okay because of their religion okay they are energetic because you're young okay and they're united because quite honestly uh the Europeans don't really like them they're they are an outcast they're considered an enemy by the Europeans so if trends continue then it is most likely that Muslims will will control Europe in 25 years time okay does it make sense but not only that but you look at America okay let's look at America you have a similar situation going on sorry okay look at 2050 what's happening okay all right so the white population is declining okay right now it's a majority but by 2050 it will no longer be the majority um Asians are increasing by a bit but not that much okay but the real growth is in Hispanics in Hispanics okay and not only are they going in absolute numbers but again they're are much more young much more energetic uh group who are more likely to have children okay and they are united because they are Catholics so they have a common religion they have a common language they have a they have very similar common cultural um traits so that's it according to game theory if you're an immigrant your best strategy is not to do well in school make a lot of money that will get you nowhere you're just playing by the rules of the game your best strategy is to stick together with your ethnic group have lots of babies maintain your religion and over time your children your grandchildren will come to dominate the nation okay does that make sense guys any questions before I move on okay the problem with this is that there is no way that the majority the white people will just sit back and let this happen okay you're going to have a lot of violence a lot of conflict because from the white perspective this is population replacement okay if we just let demographic trends continue if these outsiders just have a lot of kids and we don't have the kids then eventually our culture will be destroyed and they're right okay historically they're right and how do we know because let's talk about some history all right so last semester we talked about the protoindo-uropeans right okay so this is Europe this is Asia uh Anatolia okay so remember that after the ice age hunter gatherers spread around okay okay you have hund gatherers around but then because as the uh earth was warming this allowed for agriculture and so a new group came into being that focused on agriculture okay these are the farmers these are farmers and they arrived primarily in Anatolia and the Leavant and Mesopotamia because that was the warmest part of the globe that was most amendable to agriculture but then if you remember there's always climate change and because of climate change they're not forced to migrate okay and a lot migrated to Europe and when they went to Europe they forced out the hunter gatherer okay it was not violent because hunter gatherers have very few people and they allow and they can move about okay but eventually what happened is that the farmers were able to displace place the hunter gatherers okay now they're established in Europe you also had uh farmers who went into the steps but remember from last semester we discussed the steps and how because it's grassland you can't actually farm there or it's very hard to farm there so they develop a new economy called uh nomadic pasturalism which is to say that they raised sheep goat and cows and they migrated from one area of the grassland to the next okay and as a result they became very strong very aggressive people and again because of overpopulation because of climate change these people are now forced to migrate to Europe okay they migrate to Europe and what happened now well now there's a war that lasts 100 years 20 years in which the pneumatic pastoralists the Annayia or the Puerto Indo-Uropeans they displaced or they eliminated the the farmers okay and so what happened we know this from genetic studies is that the men the uh European farmers were killed and the woman were taken as basically bride uh brides okay slaves basically okay so this is a population replacement and this historically is what happens okay one group comes in and replaces the other and throughout most of human history this is a constant cycle because the steps were extremely violent and chaotic and this forces groups to constantly migrate to other places in search of safety and in each time there is population replacement okay primarily in the elite okay so we so there are very few instances of um situ where groups come together and they are peaceful no because you you only have one elite and and one elite must replace the other elite okay does doesn't make sense guys all right so if this is historically the situation how did we get into a situation where immigration has become the norm in today's world okay before historically we believe that you have to stay together as part of your group otherwise you'll be eliminated and now we believe that hey if you don't like where you are it's okay just get up and move somewhere else and maybe it'll be better better economic opportunities for you this is a shift in mentality a shift in mindset okay this came about because of the British Empire all right okay so this is Europe this is South America uh USA Canada um Australia New Zealand okay all right so you have Spain and Spain because of the Ottoman Empire Spain could not access the uh East Indies trade okay so it had to figure out new ways to access uh East Asia China uh China India because that was where a lot of spices were okay and there's huge demand for spices so they started to chart new new areas okay spain and Portugal primarily and what they discovered was there's all this new territory in South America now South America is interesting because in South America you had a huge population and there was a lot of mineral wealth silver and gold and so what they could do was they go could go over there and enslave the population okay so slavery and then you convert them to to Catholic religion all right so basically the easiest areas to colonize Spain and Portugal took right right away but then afterwards um Britain England start to play this game as well okay and they also sent colonists but the problem was that there was no large population to enslave also there were a lot especially United States there were a lot of aggressive uh Indians okay natives and so the solution was the United States after one independence from Britain it welcomed immigrants from Europe specifically um Ireland uh Germany Poland these places the reason why is they needed to displace the natives okay and then immigrants were uh were then uh encouraged to go to Canada and Australia to build their economies as well so in other words immigration today it is a historical accident the Americans were responding to the specific needs of that time okay they were a small population against a hostile people the natives in a very large area and so they needed people to come and farm and industrialize the area and that's why America welcome immigrants and this is uh new in human history where you could go to a new place and become a citizen okay usually if you went to a new place you went because you were a slave you were conquered in war and you went as cheap labor okay so in so America they welcome you as um citizens if you're willing to contribute and they allow you to get rich if you worked hard okay now fast forward and America becomes an empire because it's allowing all this energy to concentrate in America you have World War II okay you have World War II and America triumphs in World War II and now America can set the entire rules of the game for most of the world for Western Europe and at this time America said to Europe you guys fought wars you guys had fascism because you are a closed society okay close society means you don't want immigrants you're all very nationalistic and therefore you are violent america won the war because America is an open society which welcomes immigrants which is a multicultural society that encourages people to get rich and be happy and so Europe if you want to be like us if we want to prevent World War II then you have to become an open society as well and welcome immigrants just like we do okay and that's why we have the situation that where we have where now uh Muslims are going to Europe and others are going to America okay and what um we need to recognize is that immigration it's a new game developed because of certain historical circumstances but it's not sustainable in the long term and so the idea that you can just work hard in school then go to America and become wealthy that can't be true anymore in the future according to game theory what's going to happen are these violent conflicts between demographic groups because each group is trying to set the rules of the game because whoever sets the rules of the game will always win the game meaning they have access to the best uh jobs they have the high status and they have access to the best looking woman which is ultimately what every um man is looking for okay status attractive woman power money all right does that make sense guys all right any questions okay ask one question then we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll finish class okay can we really do something about the current immigration or we don't have any ability to change it okay um that's a great question and I'm sure everyone's everyone's feeling with this question which is like what can we do about this situation well I mean the problem is and I hate to say this but immigration is not natural okay and what I mean by that is that if you're born into a community what is natural is for you to want to help this community grow and develop you want to contribute to this community what is not natural is for you to say you know what this community sucks i'm going to go find a new community because if everyone did that then no communities could ever exist okay so 99% of people what their natural inclination to do is to want to work hard and make the community a better place and that's what everyone should be doing you always going to have minority people maybe 1% 2% who are sort of strange and that they have different ideas and they're not going they're not going to be able to conform to the community okay and historically these people have been killed by the communities and so it's natural for them to get up and leave okay so uh but that's only a small group of people so what's what is natural is for people to want to just stay where they are because they love their neighbors because they love their family and they want to help the community get stronger and stronger and unfortunately because because of globalization uh because of mass media because of the internet for another reason young people believe that what's important is their own individual happiness uh their own economic opportunity so I'm going to go wherever there's more economic opportunity so for example Chinese students the very best are like you know what I'm probably going to make more money United States so I'm going to work hard then immigrate to United States and then um start my own company get rich and all that and you know some people have success of doing that but if you think about it this is not good for China right as a nation why would you encourage your best and brightest to take their skills move somewhere else and contri contribute to that economy rather than to your own economy and so we're in a very strange situation and we are in this situation because for the longest time America was a global hedgeimon and could write the rules of the game and I keep on telling you guys this whatever writes the rules of the game will always win okay so globalization was system so that America could extract from the world resources um and these resources include talent okay so we have a situation where the best and brightest go to America because that's where they're most likely to thrive but now um the world is changing america is now becoming is no longer the global hedgeimon russia China these countries are rising as well and so nations now are much more interested in being able to maintain their best and brightest their talent their human capital and this is the way it should be if you're born in China then your priority ought to be like how to make China a better place it shouldn't be like I'm work really hard in school so that I can get a visa to go study United States that makes no sense okay so um and look the reality is that um if you states you can make a lot of money but you're still going to be low status okay okay and that's the situation I found myself in in North America where you know I worked really hard in school i went to Yale and I could have made a lot of money as a lawyer or as a doctor but I recognized that you know what if I just stay where I am I'm not going to um ever achieve my potential i'm not going to achieve status in America i may be wealthy but I'm never going to have achieved high status you know that's why I chose to come to China because I thought there were more opportunities to obtain higher status in China than in United States where I'm not white i'm East Asian and there's going to be a lot of stereotypes and prejudice against me because I'm East Asian okay and quite honestly I was right in my assessment all right so I So yeah you're you're saying what can East Asians America do about this right and unfortunately according to game theory they're stuck where they are okay that's why you know I chose to leave but if you're East Asian in America I'm not saying for everyone okay i'm sure there are like thousands of very happy East Asians who married very well and they have very good lives okay but for the majority um you can have decent lives but you're always going to be low status and quite honestly a lot of East Asians are happy with that situation a lot of East Asians are just happy you know getting by uh making good money and they really don't worry about status okay but the problem is that their children and grandchildren are kind of screwed over because it's going be very hard for them to uh marry okay and again there's there's a lot of East Asian men who are single and they have very and they have problems on the dating market okay all right any more questions guys is that clear great okay so we will continue this uh next week
