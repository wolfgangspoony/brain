today we look at the question of success okay the question is who succeeds and why okay so we we've done a lot of research and we've discovered that people who who succeed um succeed for certain reasons so there is a Colombia psychologist named Walter Mitchell and he devised a very famous experiment called the marshmallow test in the marshmallow test it's very very easy okay so imagine a room and I invite a fouryear-old or 5-year-old to come into this room and have a conversation with him or her i ask him "How's your mother what do you like to do?" And it's a very good conversation then suddenly I get up and say "I'm really sorry but I need to go across the hallway for another meeting but I'll be back okay so just wait for me and here and here I'll make you a deal here's a marshmallow i'm going to put a marshmallow in front of you and you can have it right now but if I come back and the marshmallow is still there I will give you two marshmallows okay and and then uh Walter Mitchell he goes away and he goes behind the room and for a seeth through mirror he's able to see the students as they struggle to contain themselves because obviously they want two marshmallows and there are some students who can in fact resist the temptation to eat the first marshmallow and then a second marshmallow but then there are others who cannot and Walter Mitchell will spend 50 years just tracking them okay what he discovers is this the students who resist the temptation who get the second marshmallow there are much more likely to do better in school they have higher test scores they have better careers their careers are more stable they get promoted in their careers they're much more able to find a stable relationship um they avoid jail they avoid drugs they avoid alcohol they're more lean they're more fit they live longer better teeth and those who cannot resist and eat the first marshmallow right away they have the opposite effect okay and so the idea is that for Walter Mitchell success means delayed gratification and all this means is that people who succeed are capable of longterm planning to succeed today I will make sacrifices necessary okay so RA so if my friends are playing outside and I need to do my homework well I'm going to stay home do my homework okay so long-term planning what he calls delayed gratification or a much more simple way of saying this is the idea of self-control right or the idea of emotional regulation you're able to keep your emotions in check if you're angry you're able to calm yourself down okay and so we've tried we know about this and that's why in school we focus on the idea of emotional regulation teaching you how to better control your emotions how to do long-term planning okay so that's one theory of success another theory of success comes to us from another psychologist named Carol Dwight and she's at Stanford and she wrote a book called Mindset okay and what she tells us is that those who succeeded in life have a growth mindset and those who fail in life have a fixed mindset okay and it's not hard okay the the idea is resilience those of a growth mindset if they fall or they fail they say to themselves "This opportunity for me to learn so I'm going to think about what I did wrong next time I'll do better." And a fixed mindset are people who cannot accept the idea of failure who think that it's because they're not capable of improving and therefore they give up okay so those with a growth mindset if they fail they try harder those who have a fixed mindset if they fail they just give up and so the idea of resilience okay pretty simple right and the third idea of success comes to us from K anders Ericson who is a Swedish psychologist and she wants to know why certain people are able to succeed as musicians or athletes and he creates the idea of deliberate practice okay so what he found is that people who want to become athletes or musicians they work really hard they practice every day but the people who succeed practice strategically okay so those who uh work hard just work a long time but those who work strategically have a plan the plan is this what are my goals how can I achieve these goals and then how do I improve my plan okay so they're examining their own practices and they're trying to figure out where the weaknesses are where they can improve instead of plan on how to improve and then they follow his plan and if this plan helps them improve they stick to a plan but if the plan doesn't really work they change the plan as well okay so this is the idea of selfreflection or selfassessment constantly thinking about how you are as a student and figure out figure out how to improve your own learning strategies and what Kersner Ericson discovered is that if you do this you'll succeed at anything and this is true okay right and the the reason why we know it's true is there are two American psychologists named Dunning Dunning and Krueger something the Dunning Krueger effect and so what they did was this they ran an experiment they have 500 students in their psychology class first year university they made every student take an IQ test and then after they took the IQ test they asked each student "How do you think you did on the IQ test do you place in the top 5% or the bottom 5%." And it turns out that no one got the ranking correct okay so those who were in the top 5% um in terms of IQ thought they were maybe in the top 20% because for them it was easy so they assumed everyone for everyone else it was easy as well but what was um dramatic is that those who scored the lowest thought they were average okay so the worst 5% in the class thought they were in the top 50% or just average and the easy and the reason why is those people who are stupid lack the capacity to know they're stupid okay so what Dunning Kuba discovered is that the hardest part of being a student is to assess yourself properly to know exactly where you stand and how to improve those who are stupid are often the most confident in the world that's what what's called the Dunning Krueger effect and this is this helps explain why the world is why it is because often the people in power are stupid they don't know they're stupid they were confident and they do stupid things like Donald Trump okay all right all right so now we have these three theories right we have self-control we have resilience and we have self assessment and which and and so as educators as schools what we can do is deise strategies and curriculum to help students all succeed correct right the problem is that when we actually try this it doesn't work okay if you take a bad student and you teach him self-control resilience and self assessment the student doesn't actually get better the reason why is okay and this is a very important idea for you guys to remember is that correlation does not equal causation okay you guys you guys need to remember this just because things are correlated does not mean they cause each other so I'll give you an example we know that successful people they get up early in the morning okay they get up at four o'clock in the morning but just because you get up at four o'clock in the morning does not mean you'll succeed okay just because you work hard just because you're resilient just because you have growth mindset does not mean you'll succeed but if you're successful you will get up early in the morning because you're more you are more motivated if you are successful in life you will have more cons self self-control you will have uh more resilience you you'll be more humble okay does that make sense so if you're rich guess what happens you become successful and therefore you will have growth mindset self-control deliberate practice okay does that make sense but just because you have growth mindset deliver practice and resilience does not mean you'll succeed okay so the question for us is why does this happen and ultimately who succeeds okay so we know for a fact that rich people are much more likely likely to succeed than poor people and in fact what we know from macroeconomic studies is that school doesn't really matter doesn't matter how well you do in school if your parents are rich you'll be successful in life if your parents are poor you will not be successful in life okay so what's the difference okay so now let's look at parenting strategies between rich and poor okay so there are lots of differences but let's focus on three major differences the first major difference is that rich parents speak to their kids more than poor parents okay high vocab vocabulary low vocabulary when rich parents speak to the kids rich parents will use higher vocabulary longer sentences poor parents will just be no yes go away okay another major difference is in attitude okay so rich parents use a friendly attitude and poor parents use an authoritarian or command attitude so for example if you are a rich kid and you go and touch a stove stove okay and you burn your hand the rich parent will say "Listen you made a mistake don't worry about it let me explain to you why touching a fire is bad for you because you'll burn yourself and you might have to go to doctor and uh we will feel pain if you hurt yourself okay so the rich parent will spend a lot of time explaining to the child why this is wrong and how not to do it again the poor parent is like don't you ever do that again or I'll beat the crap out of you okay don't do that pretty simple okay but as you can you can understand the rich kid will understand that the world is safe and that he is respected in this world okay whereas the poor child will think that the world is scary and he or she must be afraid of adults and this carries on into school right because as a rich kid you go into school and you think that oh my teacher is my friend so you smile at the teacher and you hug the teacher and the teacher smiles back and now you're friends right but if you're a poor kid and you see the teacher you don't you're afraid to look at the teacher you don't smile you're you are stressed okay and the teacher thinks that you might be a problem child so the problem with this is that yes being a third parent it is effective but it creates stress in the family okay it makes the child feel unsafe and this leads to our the third major difference between rich parents and poor parents rich parents offer stability okay poor parents can only offer volatility this is a very simple idea rich parents have money so they can afford to keep promises so I'm rich parent i say to my child "Okay next week we'll go to Thailand for vacation guess what next week you go you guys go to Thailand for vacation." But if you are a poor parent money is always an issue so it's hard for you to keep promises right so it's like "Next week we'll go to McDonald's for lunch but your paycheck um is not enough." So you're like "Sorry we can't go anymore." Okay and now because of these different parenting styles we understand why um rich kids behave different from poor kids right so let's look at let's look at the idea idea of self-control right self-control what is the marshmallow test marshmallow test is not a test of self-control it's a test of your trust in others right if you believe that the teacher who goes outside if you believe that he or she comes back and will pro when will keep his or her promise then you will not eat that marshmallow but if you think that this teacher is lying to me then you're not going to eat that marshmallow then you will eat that marshmallow right so it's not really about self-control it's about your belief and trust in authority figures right so if you're rich stability you have stability but if you're poor you don't have stability so you're actually better off eating that marshmallow rather than waiting for that second marshmallow because guess what most of the time you will not get that second marshmallow okay do you do you understand so it's not that poor kids are stupid poor kids are rational and they're responding to the circumstances that they live in okay and resilience right well the idea of resilience is that you believe that the world will help you right so if you're rich and you believe that everyone helps you you can be resilient because if you fail someone will help you get up if you're poor if you fail that probably tells you you should be doing this okay you probably won't succeed doing this so you don't have you don't have much confidence in others okay and the idea of self assessment right looking inward well if you're a poor child who lives under a lot of stress it's hard for you to be self-reflective because if you look back at yourself all you think about is your pain and your stress okay so from these different parenting strategies we can now explain why different students behave the way they do this of course may lead you to think okay well then rather than construct our schools around self-control resilience and um self-reflection we should construct our schools around better parenting skills okay which means that hey let's construct schools where kids are exposed to a lot of vocabulary uh where teachers are friendly and where there's a lot of stability okay and we've tried this and it's more effective but it doesn't really work either why because the kids come in too late a lot of their worldview is already established then you're like "Okay well then let's change how parents behave." And when you do that what you recognize is that nope you can't change how they behave either okay so no matter what you do you end up with massive differences between the poor and the rich the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor okay so now the question for us is why is this the case okay and it's the case because society is a hierarchy okay and the hierarchy is usually divided between the rich and the poor okay and these two worlds are night and day they're very very different as a poor person if you want to survive you have to obey authority okay but if you're a rich person the way that you get along with others the way that you maximize your outcome is by negotiating with others okay negotiating okay so negotiating can also mean debate right so who should be the boss well let's have a debate and present different evidence as to to figure out who's who should be the boss okay so negotiation means debate and argument so this helps us this helps us understand why different parents parent their child differently if you're a poor parent your responsibility is to make sure that your child knows how to obey authority okay that's why you command your child but if you are a rich parent you want your child to be able to negotiate with authority and that's why you respect your child and you teach your child how to debate how to argue how to negotiate with others okay because they live in different worlds another way of saying this is that from day one rich kids know that they're playing a different game than they're playing a different game from poor kids okay so let's go back and look at parents okay so um per poor parents command their child um don't really speak don't communicate um and don't keep promises okay all right so poor parents do these three things and we know that if they do these three things the outcome won't be so good okay and the reason why they do this is that they're not playing a game to improve their kids outcome they're playing a game to get along with other parents okay okay colleagues family okay authority okay so another way of saying this is this police boss okay family okay all right so as a parent you're trying to figure out how how to negotiate with the police with your boss and with your family so if you're a poor person and the police knows you're a poor person the police is going to bully you and if you fight back the police will probably put you in jail okay so it's very important that you accept authority you don't challenge authority because if you do you'll probably get into trouble your boss right if you're a poor person your your boss will just command you about and so it's very important that your child knows how to take orders rather than ask questions rather than debate your child must learn how to just follow orders or at least keep his mouth shut okay and then family is about maintaining good relations with those who can most support you and that often means the same values okay so if the if your family members or your friends if they are ch if they are parenting their child in this manner you're also going to copy them okay imitation all right and for a poor person this is the optimal strategy of how to parent okay does it make sense guys because if you do another way okay if you are if you choose to uh be a friend to your child if you choose to communicate if you choose to keep your promises then the your friends and your family will think that you're doing something wrong you understand they they won't think "Oh my god you are an enlightened parent who's read a lot of parenting books and great for you." They're going to think there's something wrong with you okay so let let me give you an example of this let me give you an example of this so my wife and I have three kids okay my parenting style so my wife and I have three kids and this is how we parent our kid okay first of all we have our child we give our child a lot of freedom so So we don't have our kids do activities okay we don't have our kids do lots lots of lots of activities we don't send our kids to math class we don't send our kids to swimming class we don't send our kids to piano class okay we just let our kids run around and play the other thing that we do is we communicate a lot with our child okay communication we believe in democracy in our in our family if there's if we're going to make a decision together we want everyone to communicate together okay um so a normal Chinese family will just have a very tight schedule right and then the other thing that we do that's different is we tell stories the other Chinese families will do math okay so we raise our children in a way that's very different from normal Chinese families from the way that you you've been raised okay and we do this because both my wife and I we spend a lot of time talking about parenting i've read a lot of books about parenting i spent many decades researching the best education possible and so that's why we raise our children in this way and guess what because we do this we have no friends in China we have family but they all think we're crazy okay but we do this because for us what's most important is to make sure that our children are happy and healthy and that they have a chance to be creative and be successful in life because I think that if you do it this way the child will not be creative will not be successful but if you do it this way your child will fit in into China better okay so parenting the goal the incentive is not for your child to succeed it's the incentive is for your child to fit into China or the larger social environment that you are in okay and that's why it's very hard to change the way people behave and that's why social structures are extremely rigid because the game they're playing is often just to fit into their environment okay does that make sense guys okay any questions before I move on uh yep thanks uh so so for poor families is there any way for the poor kids to be succeed to be the the rich parents you describe in the future okay that's that's a really good question okay um so we know that there are certain poor kids who do succeed for example I'm a poor kid who succeeded my um we imig immigrated to Toronto Canada when I was like 6 years old and my father was a dishwasher so we were very poor family okay and but I succeeded because I left Canada for the United States so Canada is a very rigid place where poor people basically move up a bit but not too far but I was able to succeed because I was able to get a scholarship to go study in the United States okay so there are opportunities the problem though is that it means leaving your community okay does that make sense so one way to succeed is to abandon your community okay but that's high risk right so you have to be extremely individualistic to take such a risk so that's why most most people don't do it because you think about it the safest option for you is to stay within your community that's what's going to guarantee you uh the most the the best outcome but if you choose to abandon your community and just say and just say you know what I'm going to go somewhere else and try my try my luck that's taking a really high risk okay so you to succeed you have to take high risk so another possibility is war um that traditionally historically has been uh the best mechanism of social mobility when you when you go fight a war and you do really well you'll get promoted in life okay but again war is high risk because chances are you'll get killed okay so not just war but also revolution right okay and of course um the best way of course is to marry up marrying up okay and that's why remember remember in our very first class we talked about the dating game right where women only want five and four okay the reason why is that five and four are high status and 321 are low status so if you're a woman you don't want to marry into a low status family because your children will be screwed over okay your best option is to take a risk gamble into a high stat and marry you want you want to try to marry into a high status family okay so traditionally um war and marrying up are the two major mechanisms of social mobility in today's world um uh abandoning community can also lead to success okay basically immigrating to a place that offers more social social mobility which often means United States okay but another way of saying this is you have to get really lucky guys okay so there's lots of poor people who think that you know I succeeded because I worked hard and I'm really talented look I was born poor i lucked into Yale okay it's luck you can work out you can work as hard as you want but the chances are are against you okay and it takes a certain personality which is you're really individualistic you're very ambitious and you have high risk tolerance most people don't have that okay so yes there are certain people who despite their background they're able to succeed but that's often the exception to the rule as opposed to the rule itself okay so So thank you is this clear okay any more questions guys before I move on okay can be luck counted as a kind of ability or is just coincidence okay that's a really good question yeah okay yep so you're absolutely right okay so luck is a form of strategy okay strategy and all this is saying is that you are trying to position yourself in a place that allows you to get lucky okay so I left Canada and I went to United States because I knew that in Canada doesn't matter how hard you work no one cares but in the United States if you work really hard then you might get lucky and you might meet someone who's like "Wow you're a really hard worker i want to promote you." Okay so so you're right in that yes you can strategize and increase your luck but it's still luck all right and those who succeed are able to think strategically and far ahead and position themselves in a way that allows them to get lucky okay and they often have the characteristics that we talked about you know like so self-control resilience and the ability to look inward and better understand what you're good at okay so it takes a combination of factors but the point I'm trying to make is that these people are only a minority are a minority okay 1% of the population really okay and they still depend on luck any more questions before I move on okay so this leads us to a question which is okay well the way that I frame everything okay the way that I frame everything you have poor and you have rich and as discussed they live in their own world worlds and they don't really connect with each other they have different parenting strategies they have different outlooks the rich stay with themselves the poor stay amongst themselves so this looks like a very stable system right stability or the word we can use is equilibrium now the question then is why do societies collapse why are there revolutions why are there social changes this looks like an like a system of equilibrium where because of parenting people know their place and people know how to best strategize about maintaining their place so why are they why is there social change and the reason why is that this system has problems and it's stable but the main problem is this system okay it's it's the rich that's problematic and the reason why is that the rich are taught from day one to negotiate a better outcome okay so know another know another way of saying this is that the poor is like minimum outcome okay the rich want the maximum outcome the poor are like you know what if I'm you know if I'm alive if I have a decent job I'm okay the but the rich are like no I need to be the top dog I need to improve my lot in society otherwise what's the point of my life okay so they have high expectations okay high expectations low expectations okay and this is a problem because power it's a zero- sum Okay hierarchy is a zero sum game so only a few people can be at the top so eventually you get a you get into a situation where there are too rich people too many few too many rich people and not enough powerful positions and this this is what's called elite overp production okay and then what happens here is that in order to um get power certain factions of the rich will align with certain factions of the poor against the um powers that be okay so all revolutions are always between the have a lot versus have some it's never between rich and poor it's always between half a lot and half some so the people who led the Chinese revolution right people like Mudon join Lai Don Ping they were not poor people they didn't come from poor families but they weren't rich enough okay so the Chinese revolution was really between the urban elite versus the rural elite okay the have a lot versus have some if you look at every revolution in human history that's always been the case okay if you go back to Chinese history and you look at all these revolutions that started in China it was it was always led by um the middle class or the aspirational class usually merchants right merchants because they were discriminated heavily in society but they had money and they wanted to transform their money into power and so when times were bad when people were looking for change they took the initiative and led people into revolution okay okay does it make sense guys all right any questions yeah all right so you said the revolution was uh initiate be uh within those rich people so how could they lead the poor people to to to vote to follow them to start the revolution because revolution need a huge amount of people like the public face to um like yeah to to initiate okay okay great question okay so revolutions are almost the same so over time because of the structure because of the inequality between rich and poor certain problems arise okay so and these problems are extremely common the first problem okay problems the first problem is indebtedness because the rich have a monopoly over wealth for the poor to survive they need to borrow money but over time because of interest rates the poor find themselves in slavery okay because if you can't afford to pay back the bank or the rich person then your body is collateral okay so you become a slave but not only do you become become a slave but your children become slaves as well so slavery becomes a very common problem and then the third issue of course is landlessness okay so these are the three most common problems that ultimately become the seeds of revolution um the poor get into debt and so they lose their land and their children become slaves the children their children's children become slaves as well okay because because of interest rates it's impossible for you to pay back that debt okay so now you have a majority of people who have absolutely no incentive to live so what happens now is that um a elite okay say to these people follow me into revolution and I will clear your debts i will give you land and I will end slavery and that's it okay every single revolution has been like this there have been different names okay so for example communists are like we'll create a communist paradise what's a communist paradise a communist paradise is where debt is canceled where people are given land and where no one's a slave okay then others like okay we'll create a religious paradise islam okay so Muhammad um the Islamic Revolution was about this initially later on it changed right and Muhammad said to everyone we're going to create the kingdom of heaven what's the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is where people don't have debt where people have land to feed themselves and where there are no slaves so if you are a Muslim you can never be a slave okay so look at every single revolution it's this pattern where over time because of inequality in society you have uh people who fall into too much debt they become slaves they have no land and then because of elite overp production you have this faction that splinters off and who in order to um obtain power get the people on their side okay and you look at the Roman civil war Julius Caesar was was saying the same thing right why was he so popular because he was saying to the Roman people if I become king I will get rid of your debt i will free you of slavery and I will give you land and that's why they had to kill him hey why is Donald Trump so popular in America right now same thing man where Americans are in debt to their credit cards student loans their houses and so they believe that Donald Trump were to come to power if you want to become king what's the first United King does what the first United King always does is cancel all debts because if you cancel all debts who loses power it's the rich who lose power and it's the rich who almost dangerous to a king okay does that make sense okay so so again this is a very similar pattern in human history it's all game theory okay any more questions guys okay ask one more one more question that then we'll break okay is this clear to you guys okay so another way of understanding this is that according to game theory individuals don't really matter okay you have to look at large groups you have to look at large large social trends okay you cannot really change the outcome for certain groups of people like poor kids unless you look at the overall structure in which they they live okay one more question guys then we'll break for the day yeah alan so like is that the uh the society or like just the elite that really rule the country who really have the power have the motivations to maintain a society that a certain degree of social mobility is allowed but not all of them but but but not a really a big social mobility so that first firstly they can maintain their power but second like they give the lower class people a hope to get into the rich class uh but not using like revolutions or other things that will like turn this society into collapse okay yeah okay look you're absolutely right so social mobility is really the best form of governance right as long as you enable people with talent and ability and ambition to climb up they'll be happy and your society will be very stable but not only will be very stable it will be very prosperous very creative it doesn't matter what system you have okay so the example is okay America 1950s was a democracy and there's a lot of social mobility um and so people worked really hard and America became very wealthy but guess what in China 1950s China was not democracy it was it was a communist system but in 1950s people worked really hard as well why because China was destroyed after decades of war and there were lots of opportunities for social mobility if you worked hard you got promoted very quickly in the system so even though it was a communist system not a capitalist system even though it was it was it was a commanding economy rather democracy people worked really hard because they thought that by working hard they can improve their lives so social mobility is the best form of governance you don't need democracy you don't need any any system okay as long as you have social mobility people will be happy the problem though is that over time less than a generation all the positions of power are failed okay so the people with talent who made the country great who made the country wealthy when they when they get into power they don't want people like them to replace them they want their children to replace them okay and over time these children are a lot so what happens is at the very top all the positions are filled and there's a waiting list as well so if you are a poor person who is who works hard really talented unfortunately all those positions at the top are filled already and the wait and there's also waiting list so too bad okay and this is and again you just look at Chinese history right look at Chinese history where at the beginning of the dynasty you had all these talented people take the civil civil uh entrance examination the kju and these are really taught people but then what happens is that they they have children and they teach their children how to do on the kju and then eventually they're like you know what we'll just cheat so they corrupt the kju and then eventually like you know what screw this whoever can pay to pass a kju will pass a kju and then all the positions at the very top are filled there's no more social mobility so what do people do they engage in revolution right so you look at hio tren right he he failed the kju or he there was no position at the top for him so he started so he believed He became brother brother of Jesus right and he started this revolution that claimed tens of millions of lives in China why because there was no social mobility for him 50 years ago prior he would have been a he would have been a civil servant same thing for Maong right by the time that Maong became a university student the ku had been eliminated so there's no way for him to climb the ladder anymore therefore he had to start engaging in new ideas okay so you're absolutely right in that social social mobility is the best way to maintain social harmony but people have children and they want the children to succeed and they will arrange a system in a way that only their children can succeed which screws over every other children every everyone else and so they have no choice but to overthrow the system okay or another way of saying this is game reset game reset this is what a revolution is okay so another way another way of saying this is that 100 people are playing a game 10 people are winning and they keep on winning and they can only win so everyone else is like screw this game let's start a new game and the 10 people are like nope we're happy playing this game they can't agree so the United people can only the only thing they can do is a revolution which allows for game reset which now again allows for social mobility and that is the course of human history okay either you um climb up the ladder if they don't allow you to climb up climb up the ladder then you'll just break the game okay so but unfortunately again once you're in power you want your children to inherit your power and so you will rig the game in a way that only your children can succeed okay and that's why the school that's that's why the schools are the way they are okay schools for the rich are very different from the very different from schools for the poor right schools for the rich there's a lot of freedom there's a lot of creativity the teachers are very good you go to poor schools and it's the complete opposite and the reason why is the system is set up to make sure that certain people succeed and everyone else fails okay does that make sense Alan okay great any more questions guys all right good i'll see you guys next class
