today we discuss communism Marxism we will discuss uh what it is where did it come from and why did it succeed now the 20th century um had the cold war and so that was an ideological struggle between capitalism and communism and for the longest time we believe that capitalism and communism were polar opposites a dialectic okay a black and white but if that is the case then how do we explain China because for the longest time China was a communist country and then in 1980s it started to reform and now China is very much a capitalist country in fact if you think about it this transition has been seamless there hasn't been much conflict because of this transition and this is not true historically where um transitions have been very violent okay okay so think of the transition from um feudalism to capitalism okay that was a very violent process think of the process from Catholic Europe into Protestant Europe that was also a very violent process but in China communism transitioned into capitalism pretty easily pretty quickly and extremely successfully okay and in fact you could say that today China is very much a capitalist country with some communist elements but it's very much capitalistic so the question then is if these two ideologies capitalism communism are such polar opposites if it's a dialectic then how this happened in China and what I want to show you today is that actually this is a false dialectic okay meaning that communism and capitalism are actually more similar than they are different in fact what I will show you is that in many ways communism is a creation of capitalism as a weapon to destroy capitalism capitalism's major enemies okay so communism is not really the enemy of capitalism the real enemies of capitalism are different ideologies okay so these ideologies include monarchy the idea of monarchy is that rather than power in the hands of a capitalist power is in the hand of the king okay and what a king often does is redistribute capital in a way that is more fair so for example when a king first comes into power what a king often does is cancel all debts and redistribute the land and that's why he's so popular okay so capitalists are afraid of kings they don't want kings because a king will often redistribute property another great enemy of capitalism is religion or theocracy okay the idea here is that all religions teach you that money is evil right god doesn't want you to make money god wants you to be kind to others to love your children to be a nice person okay so that's why in Catholic Europe they were so poor because people were more focused on redemption and salvation than they were on making money okay so theocracy is also a major enemy of capitalism then you also have nationalism nationalism is the idea of loyalty to your people loyalty to your nation for capitalism that's a problem okay because capitalism wants to be loyal to capital and it wants capital to flow through across borders so I see an investment opportunity in China i want to take my money from America and put it into China i don't want to worry about oh China's my enemy china is not my people okay so nationalism is also a major problem and then you also have another problem okay called democracy so believe it or not capitalists hate democracy why do they hate democracy because if you think about it if people had power the workers had power they would all get together and vote to redistribute wealth right to make the rich pay more taxes we call this socialism okay so you think about it the enemy of capitalism is not communism it's these four other things if you you actually think about it okay communism is is working with capitalism to destroy all four of these things right so let's look at this monarchy okay communism does not allow for monarchs to arise it allows for a party to arise right what is a party party is an oligarchy all right which is a capitalist system now theocracy what does Mark say mark says is that religion is the opiate of the people religion is the great evil of the world religion creates false consciousness therefore we must destroy all religion right and if religion is destroyed what is left the only thing that is left is money okay now nationalism national communism is international right workers of the world unite so nationalism is also bad we want to unite as a world all workers unite the class consciousness is more important than national identity right now democracy no no no this is bad too right because workers cannot um defend their rights workers have false consciousness workers have been brainwashed by the capitalists in school in the media by the internet by Hollywood okay therefore a vanguard the party must lead the people into socialism all right so this is really convenient how capitalist and communism have similar enemies and communism helps destroy all four enemies in a way that capitalism cannot right so you could also you could also make the argument that maybe communism was a weapon or a virus created by capitalism in order to conquer the world in order to destroy the world so that capitalism can spread throughout the world and China is an example of this right think of think about the cultural revolution that destroyed religion that destroyed tradition that destroy cultural identity and what happened after the cultural revolution china became capitalist and it became hyper capitalistic china had the fastest growth rate economic growth rate in the world how did that happen okay so I'm not saying this is true i'm saying like this something for us to think about all right all right so let us now think about this and again um this is all just speculation on my part okay I don't really know I'm saying like you know why is this happening why is this the correlation right all right so an example is Kar Marx and Kar marks of course is the founder of communism um and the history of K Marx is like really really strange So for example um he is a German citizen but he spent all his time in Britain he was exiled from Germany because they advocated for world revolution so he went to Britain but Britain is also a capitalistic country so why is it that he's allowed to do whatever he wants in Britain he he wrote most of his works in a British library in a in a um the British museum so why did the British authorities allow him to do that that's a question for us right britain is the most capitalist country in the world at this time 19th century and Britain basically allow Marx to live there and do whatever he wants okay that's strange number two is Karl Marx where did he get his money from okay so Karl Marx actually his wife is a German aristocrat so she's used to luxury but Karl Marx never made any money in his life right who if he writes these works the Congress manifesto that's capital no one's going to read them they don't sell right so he's not a wealthy person but we know for a fact that he actually lived a very good life okay he wasn't an aristocrat he wasn't wealthy but he was middle class his kids went to private school they had a nice house in Britain so the question is where did he get his money from well what they say is he got his money from his partner Frederick Engles and where did Frederick Engles get his money from well his father was a capitalist an industrialist so there here's a question for you why would his father who is a very wealthy person let give angles a lot of money to give to Marx and Marx is calling for a world revolution to destroy the capitalists why would they do that okay that's kind of strange the third thing is that at this time socialism was the most dominant ideology for many reasons okay okay and the idea of of socialism is that um it will evolve naturally okay but Mark says no no no we cannot allow it to evolve naturally it will not evolve naturally we need a revolution okay we need a world revolution right so that's a question for us why would he say this okay so so let's look at what socialism is and then let's look at what communism is okay let's look at socialism all right the idea of socialism is pretty simple all right so before you had a feudal society and then it became industrial because it becomes industrial you have lots and lots of workers okay and you have capitalists the problem though is that capitalism exploits labor it makes people very unhappy okay so the workers want change then you have the industrialist the capitalist the problem is that capital consolidates okay so maybe you have a thousand capitalists to start but then maybe 10 will take over all the money okay all the means of production the factories then maybe one okay because that's how capitalism works it consolidates which means that eventually the capitalist will turn against capitalism as well okay and because of democracy because people can vote they can then together affect political change and this will lead to socialism what is socialism socialism is just a redistribution of wealth okay a redistribution of wealth now let's for for the sake of simplicity say there are three classes okay you have the rich you have the middle class and you have the poor okay right so all redistribution is doing is taking the money from the rich and giving it to the poor you understand but because of this what happens is the middle class improves in status and power okay so if you look at the system you would think okay look the poor want this system because they have more money they have more equality but also the people who really want the system are the middle class because it means that over time they have more power and status than the rich right and this is a pretty powerful coalition that's why socialists believe that over time this is just a natural evolution and this is true for most of human history right so after World War II Europe didn't become communist it didn't become capitalist it became socialist it had a very strong welfare system okay so just the natural course of human history socialism will become inevitable okay doesn't make sense to you guys okay because this is a majority of people but Mark's had problems with this okay Mark says "Okay all right the major problem with this is class sorry false consciousness okay you think that this is a natural process but capitalists the ruling elite have a lot of tricks up their sleeves." Okay for example um they can brainwash the workers right so for this to work out you need to create true consciousness so you you need to destroy religion you need to revamp the educated system you need to control the media okay otherwise the capitalist will use the schools the media religion to brainwash the workers and also these workers need to unite together across the world to have true power okay why because the real struggle is one of class okay consciousness and for socialism to arise we need to destroy class okay so the idea of the middle class obtaining power that's bad what we should have is just everyone the same okay equality right and that's the idea of Marxism to destroy all property okay that's the that's the main difference between socialism and communism socialism is the redistribution of property communism is the destruction of property but if you do it this way what happens is that the middle class now lose status right and so it's both the rich and middle class that suffer under communism and therefore they will probably unite together against the poor you understand so it sounds similar socialism and communism but it's night and day socialism seems like the natural evolution of things okay and so it sounds right so why is Mark screwing screw screw around this okay he also says that okay you also need a party you also need a vanguard an elite to destroy the false consciousness unite the workers and create a communist society and when they do that when when system is completely communist then the party will give up power and you will have a socialist paradise but then the question then is why would the party give up power right so if the part is capable of of creating consciousness why don't they just switch to a different false consciousness okay so the problem with Marx is that it's working on socialism and making it more extreme it's also making it more confusing and why would he do that okay it's very confusing now all right and my argument to you is that when this happens when an idea becomes more extreme the intention is to discredit it to make it illegitimate to destroy the idea all right so if you think about it according to game theory the people responsible for communism is not Marx the people responsible for communism are the capitalists the ruling elite because they want to destroy the idea of socialism right they don't want this unity between the middle class and the work and the workers they want the middle class to to remain with the nobility and the oligarchy okay does that make sense all right so let me show how this works all right so in the field economy you have the monarch and the nobility okay and the monarch nobility have power through three mechanisms first of all they control the land uh they control the military and they control the religion okay so this is the status quo and then the peasants are the people who work the land and this was true for most of Catholic Europe but then with the rise of industrialism you have new people come into power okay so for example you have the boujo who are the boujo z boura Z are just the capitalists the factory owners okay and because of the boujo you now have the workers and then because of this industrial economy you have the middle class okay the middle class are just like lawyers teachers accountants journalists people who support the industrial economy all right now when this happens when you have a uh new groups of people emerge you now have tension you have violence okay and this is ultimately what led to the French Revolution where the new order okay these people worked together to try to overthrow the old order and this led to the Napoleonic wars seven wars fought between France and everyone else okay and that led to the deaths of millions tens of millions of people in Europe it was a deadly war and after Napoleon was defeated all the leaders the the nobility of Europe got together and sec and decided that from now on we will no longer fight war okay they create something called the concert of Europe the concert of Europe is basically um these different monarchies agreeing to resolve the differences over negotiations rather than on the battlefield so think think of it as a as a United Nations okay and it worked really really well the problem is that it worked too well because you're not resolving this problem okay you're not resolving this conflict between the new order and the old order right the these people want to maintain the status quo but these people the industrial economy wants a new a new um order that allows for democracy okay liberalism okay socialism okay so a more redistribution of wealth um greater participation in the political system and the limitations of the uh religion okay so basically the French revolution all right so right now so this system was created to avoid the French revolution but because of peace the ingredients for the re French revolution are increasing okay and this led to something called the 1848 revolutions 18848 revolutions and this happened throughout the entirety of Europe where each place there was a uprising a combination of these people the borders middle class and workers who called for changes in government okay some places were violent some places were peaceful some places focused more on democracy some place focus more on liberalism some places focus more on socialism okay all right so does that make sense after 1848 what the leaders of Europe recognized is that you know what if you don't do anything about this situation eventually the new order is going to consume us the new order of the bouro middle class and workers this alliance is going to destroy us so what can we do about it their solution is we have to divide them okay we have to divide them so before the conflicts were about power status religion okay so the first idea is let's create the idea that the real conflict is class okay so the real enemy is not between the nobility and the boujo okay the real enemy is between the boujo and the workers okay this is the real conflict right second is that we have to discredit um these people and make this movement seem extreme fanatical zealous okay and you do that by saying "Okay no property." What we want is not a warfare society what we want is a completely equal society where no one has any money no one has any rights no one has any freedom communism okay and the third way you deliberize it is say that this is a international conspiracy hey guys Jews these communists are in secret society who want to take over the entire world so it's not that oh these workers just want more rights no no no these workers are tools in an actual conspiracy to conquer the entire world they are funded by Jews by capitalists by the British who cares okay but they're not Germans they're not French they're not us do you understand so you think about it communism was a scop okay a tool used by the elite by the nobility to make the movement of democracy socialism and liberalism illegitimate okay this is his propaganda okay doesn't make sense guys all right so let's look at the evidence for this all right so this is the 1848 revolutions so what happened was that because of peace you have overpopulation you have economic growth okay that led to inequality that led to corruption that led to conflict between the bourgeo the new rising powers and the nobility the status quo powers okay and that's why you have these revolutions throughout Europe okay so look at France okay this is a French um you look at like all these places this happening all at the same time okay everywhere and again um different systems will respond differently the only place in Europe that's basically speared these revolutions is England and the reason why is that England has colonies where if you're not happy you can go somewhere else like Canada or United States or Australia New Zealand okay but you can leave but everyone else is stuck where they are and they are fighting for more rights and again this puts the fear of God into the European nobility okay for the longest time they got along they maintain peace but now the boujo the industrialists the capitalists want to overthrow the regime okay so what they do now is they sponsor the creation of communism to divide the capitalist the middle class and the workers against each other okay okay to create the idea of cast class conflict all right um okay so Karl Marx and Feder Engles all right they write something called the communist manifesto and this comes after the 1848 revolutions because they because after the 1848 revolution they are absolutely convinced that Europe is in is ready for a global revolution okay and this is their agenda and this is also a secret document because at this time the communists are secret society all around Europe okay and I would argue that this was probably being funded by the nobility okay okay so it calls for all abolition of property all right no more property that's pretty extreme so be because again remember the middle class wants to support socialism but it cannot support communism socialism is just a redistribution of wealth communism is the abolition of wealth two different things all right um all abolition of inheritance okay again you're middle class you're like I worked really hard to make this money i want to give to my children now I can't anymore okay this is pretty awful all right centralization of credit in the hands of the state okay by means of a national bank okay and you think okay this is this sounds pretty extreme but you know what we they already do this in capitalism it's called the Bank of England right all right so there are already some a lot of similar between capitalism communism remember the Bank of England is where all wealth from around the world is stored right so a centralized bank and communist system it's the same thing right um centralization of a means of communication right a party well this is just the capitalist class an oligarchy like does it really matter if um it's an oligarchy or a part it's the same thing really right um extension of factories instruments of production owned by the state equal liability of all work combination of agriculture manufacturing industries all right so this is the idea of creating a politariat all right or manufacturing and this capitalist want guys okay so for at this time most of the world is a agricultural feudal and this calls for the creation of a manufacturing industrial economy that's what Cathols want right because that way they can better exploit people um free education for all children and you're like "Oh well that's great man free schooling." No it's not because now you can brainwash them right this is brainwashing so you know you're like "Okay well this agenda is communist well if I'm a capitalist I'm okay with this agenda right i'm happy with this agenda what's wrong with this agenda right all right when the course development classations have disappeared and all production has been country enhanced vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its political character political power socalled is merely organized power of one class for oppressing another the politic during its contest with the boujo is compelled by the force of circumstances to arise of its class if by means of revolution it makes itself the ruling class as it sweeps away by force the old conditions of production than it will along these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of the class and antagonism of classes generally and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class okay all right so this sounds very public but it's not okay first of all it establishes the politarian and the party are the real enemies not between the capitalist and the monarchy uh between capitalism and religion the real conflict is class between the bar and the and the um proletariat okay and for the politician to win they need a party okay they need a vanguard party but hey once this Vanguard party establishes itself and destroys class it will go away okay you understand it will give up power voluntarily it will choose to not exist anymore this has never happened in issue before but trust us on this one okay this time it will be different all right all right okay so this is interesting in the communist manifesto it says okay Switzerland we support the radicals in Poland we support uh the aan revolution in Germany we support the boujo sorry uh um yeah the politarian okay so in different places they have different concerns they have different needs right and what these people are saying is that we're not part of the natural conspiracy all we want is a more fair just society that's all we Not we're not part of a secret society bent on world domination what the communist manifesto says is yes you are yeah we're all part of this great conspiracy to conquer the world and establish communism right so why would they do that why would they do that that's really strange guys right why would they admit we are a national conspiracy worst society this is a secret document that we read amongst ourselves but it's also possible for you to steal and show that yes there is this secret society and that's a conspiracy of Jews who are trying to destroy the world okay really interesting okay so now I want to talk about 1917 what happens in 1917 is this World War I is breaking out okay and the Russians are losing the war the SAR uh Nicholas he abdicates and now you have a democratic government in Russia but then the Bullshiks the Bolsheviks are an extreme communist faction okay they launched October revolution so basically they seize power for themselves and then have election as you can see from this election the bullshiks even though they have seized power they're not as popular okay as the socialists okay the socialists are going to argue for more gradual change the bullshiks want radical change so you can see 17 million people voted for the socialists only 10 million people voted for the Bovix even though the BICs controlled the government okay and also look look at this at the end of the day they only got 23% of the popular vote okay so they are not a popular faction they're a minority okay but and so this launches the civil war okay and as you can see at this time in history yes the communists have control over the major cities of Russia but they don't really control most of Russia in fact they have lots and lots of enemies they have the whites to deal with the whites is basically the nobility okay and they have also um allied armies who come in they have the Greens who are the peasants okay they have lots and lots of enemies and at this time in history you could not possibly expect that the Bviks would win this battle okay but they do all right here's something interesting this is the Romanoffs okay the Romanoffs sorry the Romanovs the Romanovs have been in power in Russia for hundred years okay and the Romanovs are beloved by the peasants and they themselves are part of the Orthodox tradition they're also relatives of the nobility of um of Europe okay so England and Germany all right so this is um the Sar Nicholas II the SAR here is Nicholas II okay um and and these are all his relatives this is the Romanov dynasty now when the revolution broke out you would think that they would just run away to Europe right where their relatives are they didn't do that they just stuck around so the question then is why would they just stick around the answer is they never believe they were in danger okay first of all they could not expect the Bleviks to um win out but also they're beloved by the peasants um they're part of the Orthodox church tradition and they have relatives who are the most powerful people in Europe including uh in England including in Germany right the Kaiser so they thought they were fine but then something strange happens the Blevix decides to kill every one of them okay they wipe out the Romanov family between 17 and 18 of members of the Romanov family were assassinated and you're like that makes no sense why would they do that by doing that first of all you piss off the peasants right you turn the peasants peasants against you because the peasants love the the royal family you now get the families of Europe pissed off at you because you kill their relative but also you come across as fanatical bon revolution okay and then you piss off the orthodox as well so these communists are fanatics so but let's assume they're not fanatics and let's assume that in fact they had a good reason to do this why would they do that okay and the answer is this the Romanovs had billions and billions of dollars in foreign banks okay in the city of London on Wall Street okay a lot of their wealth billions and billions of dollars is stored overseas what happens if they die what What happens if they all die right guess what these billions now belong to the foreign banks that's a lot of money man and in fact this is exactly what happened where um they all died and the foreign banks just took control over this money and this is one of the great controversies of the 20th century okay the government of Russia has been trying for a long time to get this money back and the far bank's like "Well you don't own this money it's a Romanovs who own this money." Okay so this is evidence that the communists and the capitalists actually are friends they're working together okay does that make sense guys all right let's continue all right another thing is that again the BVIS are not that popular okay the peasants are pissed off at them because they just killed a noble family there aren't that many workers so how can they fight this war well they fight this war using mercenaries okay from Lavia from China from the Hungarians okay so there's over 200,000 of these mercenaries and you're like wait a minute here how did these guys get paid the bushings don't have any money how are they getting paid right and the answer is well Wall Street guys Wall Street and the city of London gave the bushfix money to pay these mercenaries it was Wall Street who paid for these mercenaries you like why would they do that and the answer is because the bullshiks to pay washi backs created the red terror okay the red terror is when the bolshvix basically went to all the rich people in Russia the nobility says you either give me all your money or I will rip your daughter i will kill your wife i will kill you right and guess what by doing that they made a lot lot of money and that and that money went to pay Wall Street for the foreign mercenaries again capitalist and communist work well together okay then you have the allies right so Britain America France Japan sent these huge armies to Russia and everyone thought okay it should destroy communism because these are capitalists they're afraid of the communists but in fact that's how it happened okay they went to collect debt okay so Russia owed these countries money the Soviet the the Bolshevik paid off his debt so then the Allies left and attacked the whites okay all right so the Allies helped the Bviks and Wall Street gave money to the Bviks for mercenaries and that's how the BVIS won the war does that make sense all right so capitalist and communist work well together because they have a similar worldview all right so this is um a passage from a book called Wall Street and the Russian Revolution by Richard Spence okay and Richard Spence uh is a historian and he had lots of documentation where Wall Street is actually financing the BFIX and he explains why this has happened he says that Wall Street wants to destroy the Russian economy okay destroy the Russian economy because Russia is a threat okay and then it wants to steal the riches and the resources from the Russians okay that's the purpose of financing the bolshviks to destroy the Russian economy and to steal the wealth of Russia all right from 1918 until 1921 the Bolshviks reduced Russia to an economy based on barter and robbery okay so the basically stole everything from the rich the middle class and the poor to finance their war besides the opposition of private trade and the destruction of the monetary system the red regime embarked on a massive looting campaign ransacking palaces bank vaults churches and museums okay we call this asset stripping so basically the bush destroyed their own society in order to get the money to finance this war in order to pay off Wall Street okay they they appropriated every valuable they could get their hands on and stash it all in a new state treasury by the close of 1921 an estimated $450 million in valuables have been sequester there with more to come much of it that's going to be fenced abroad for a fraction of its value in capitalist hard currency okay so basically the Bviks stole everything in order in order to finance the war okay and in the process by destroying their tradition by destroying their wealth by destroying their religion by destroying their nobility it made the Soviet Union now much more amendable to capitalism that's what happened when Soviet Union fell it became capitalist okay so that shows us it shows us is that capitalism communism are not enemies they're partners in world conquest and that's what the 20th century is about all right any questions so I think for for China when the China is um officially recognized as a country most of them said that we need to pursue communism and abandon capitalism but there is like they followed Mark's thinkings and like currently there's a special term which is I think I don't know the English name but it's called Chinese unique socialism i don't know like is that a a way that the leaders deal with when the country is you know actually pursuing capitalist or is actually pursuing capitalist but the communism goal is just professed okay so China is an interesting example because when Markx was examining the world the two places he didn't really consider are Russia and China okay uh so marks okay Russia and China okay why the answer is because both are a agricultural agarian or what he calls feudal so from his perspective Russia and China have not reach a state of development which is ripe for world revolution okay for him the focus is on Germany And this makes sense because remember Britain Marx is being being supported by Britain right and Britain is a great enemy of Germany so that's why Britain would support Marx because he wants he wants because Marx Marx is trying to create a revolution in Germany which is a great enemy of Britain okay that makes sense so for Marx he doesn't he thinks that China and Russia don't really matter because they're backward they're agricultural they have monarchies okay so so it doesn't really fit into his model but then Lenin okay came and said "No you can speed up the revolution okay you don't even though peasants peasants become workers if you have a party to help the process." Okay so that was Lena's contribution and Mali is like "No you don't even need workers okay you can have a movement entirely on peasants." And then once you have won the revolution then um you can create industrial revolution so really if you think about it Mao wasn't really leading a communist revolution it was it was um you know it g it had the facade of communism but it was really a peasant uprising okay so Ma was not a great um communist theoretician like Marx or Lenin ma was a military commander okay so he he he was no different from other um peasant leaders in the past um people like um Janjang okay of of of the Ming dynasty these people um but in order to create legitimacy um in order to have support from the Soviet Union from Russia they had the communist facade okay and also communism provided a framework in order to industrialize very quickly so what's important to understand is that at this time in history Mao was trying to actually work with the United States as well okay okay he's trying to work with both the Soviet Union and the United States the United States wanted to support Changesh Chai so when Mao won basically uh the United States shut off China embargo China which forced uh Mao to fully embrace communism okay right but for Mao communism was not that important what's important is to industrialize very quickly industrialization okay so for him what's important is industrialization the other idea is the idea of national sovereignty all right so he didn't really want to be controlled by the Soviet Union if China was fully communist then Soviet Union would say well you're our you're our little brother okay but for M what was important is national sovereignty and that's what ultimately led to the Sino Soviet split in 1957 okay does that make sense all right okay so can we understand that capitalist equals to communis communism or uh capitalism equals to communism or communism is a weapon of capitalism but like if we try to pursue communism at the end we will finally achieve capitalism okay all right so capitalism is the belief that you can shut society around capital okay and this is a direct threat to the old order okay the old order which focus on uh religion um the king the military okay so the capital is like no let's get away with all this complexity let's just make capital the basis of of society okay now what happened is that as these two systems came into conflict all right um the workers wanted socialism okay social democracy so capitalism um from capitalism you had social democracy right social democracy is is is easy okay yes yes we believe in capitalism but we believe in restraints on capitalism we believe on a fair distribution of capital all right and that makes sense because well um you can't just have a few people with all the money okay all right but what happened was social democracy was both a threat to the old order as a threat to communism as well right so the old order capitalism what they did was they would mutate social democracy into communism in order to delegitimize okay delegitimize social democracy to make it this into a threat against everyone okay does that make sense right so to summarize capitalism is just a natural outgrowth of history but this comes in conflict with the old order and capitalism will give birth to social democracy all right which which is a natural response to capitalism social democracy become a threat to both the old order as and as well as capitalism capitalism and the old order are also in conflict with with each other so what they do is they conspire to create communism okay okay so in the early days communism is being supported by both the nobility and the and the capitalists but for different reasons all right and then what happens is that because of this support communism becomes much more extreme which leads to bullsheism okay or um revolution right right does that make sense how the system worked out so so we can't say okay well they all had this plan out no it's actually much more organic much more confusing than that at first they had communism just as a scop okay no one actually believe that oh my god from communism you'll have bullshism okay because bchism is just crazy okay but at first they thought communism was crazy but then it became much more mainstream and that led to the birth of bullshism which became which was really crazy at that time but over time it also became more extreme uh sorry became much more mainstream which led to the rise of communism everywhere including in China okay so 1917 1917 the October revolution it was a wild gamble and it worked because of the greed of capitalists okay but once it worked out once communism was established in Soviet Union then it changed the way people saw the world and they thought that now communism is possible anywhere including in China okay does that make sense all right any more questions guys okay great all right so we go on break for a month and then we come back from the break what we're going to do is we're going to learn we're going to take all that we've learned okay all this history all this game theory and apply it to the modern world so we look at specific current events so during the break I want you guys to focus on current events reading news right so uh America is about to attack Iran Iran soon um America is going to take over Greenland Canada um Trump is vis visiting China in April there's there's going to be a lot of news for us to cover okay so uh during the break uh please focus on keeping up with current events all right okay guys all right see you after the break
