this semester we are going to analyze a question together which is how do societies behave why do we do what we do what motivates us what drives us and there have been different theories as to what drives human behavior okay so let's go over some theories the first theory comes to us from um religion and the idea is that we are all driven in a war between good and evil there's a good side to us and there is an evil side to us there's Satan and there's God and we are constantly in a battle in ourselves okay do we move towards Satan or do we move towards God and that's the core of human civilization so religion is meant to give us the strength to show us the path towards goodness okay that's one theory another theory is comes to us from biology okay and the idea is sex we want to pass on our genes forward because that's the point of our existence if we cannot have children we all die so the point of existence is to have children and have them pass on their genes to others okay and for males and females life is different because as a man you have a penis and all you have to do is stick your penis into a woman and you're good okay that's all you have to do so you want to stick your penis in as many women as possible and that's the point of your existence but as a woman your life is different because it's hard to give birth it takes 9 months to incubate the child in your womb and then p child birth is the most painful experience anyone will have ever experienced and then the child it'll take like 16 18 years to raise a child to maturity so it's a huge investment on your part so as a female you have to be very cautious very careful about who you marry or have or or you or who you have sex with okay and so life is a struggle between men who want to put their penis into anything and women who want to be careful about who they marry okay so that's the idea of biology then of course you have the idea of race and culture that the world it's a struggle between these different races and cultures for dominance and each race each culture has their own characteristics okay so maybe the yellow rays it's they're very clever but they're very weak and then the white race are brave but kind of stupid and the black people like anyway anyway that's another theory i'm not saying it's correct i'm just saying it's a theory that people believe it then you have economics right and what they believe is that we are driven by money or self-interest we want to make as much money as possible and that's what drives us okay that's pretty simple and the last big theory is the idea of liberalism that comes from the enlightenment and here the theory is that history is a progress towards enlightenment to rationality to truth and to justice so the inevitability of history of human development is towards paradise towards heaven and maybe you know we go off track now and then but inevitably we move towards God okay and this comes to us from the enlightenment we call this liberalism okay so these are five theories there are others but these are five theories that show you the diversity the variety of ideas out there what I will do this semester is present to you another theory which I call game theory and my argument to you is that game theory is the best way to understand how humans behave what drives nations what drives societies what drives humans okay so that's my that's my argument to you this semester so the entire semester we will study game theory all right so what is game theory all right game theory is very simple the idea is that there are three components to a game just three aspects to a game there are the players the participants okay then there are the rules or the constraints um in mathematics we would call this the boundary conditions okay the limits to the game and the third aspect are the incentives basically how do you win this game what do you get from this game my argument to you this semester is that if you study all three okay figure out who the if you figure out who the players are figure out what if you understand the rules you understand the incentives then you understand how the game works and then therefore you can predict how the game will turn out okay that's the skill that I want to teach you this semester and what I want to show you or what I promise you is that if you learn game theory there'll be three major benefits to you as a student again you don't have to learn game theory you don't have you don't have to come to class but if you spend the effort to learn game theory from me then three things will benefit you okay the first benefit is that you become a better person the point of education guys it's not to get good grades or get into university or get a good job what I believe is the point of education is to make you into a better person which means that you are a much more thoughtful person who can better analyze yourself in the world around you that allows you to make better better decisions this makes you a much more curious much more moral and much more imaginative person okay so one benefit of learning game theory is you become smarter and therefore you become a better person okay that's number one number two is you'll be able to understand the world that we live in because this world is kind of stupid okay so you may have heard that Donald Trump um and the American military went into Venezuela for no real for no good reason kidnapped a president of Venezuela which is against which is against international law and then brought him back to New York City where he will stand trial it's really stupid what happened but then but our class it's not meant to say this is stupid or this is wrong because we all know it's stupid and wrong we're trying to figure out why this happened and what this will lead to and so we will be in this class studying and analyzing current events to understand how the world really works why people behave the way they they do and understand how the game of the world works and this requires you to actually follow the news okay it's not hard to spend five minutes and just read up on the news but we'll be looking at the the war in Ukraine we'll be looking at a new war between Israel and Iran we'll be looking at what's happening in South America we'll be looking at the conflict between China and Japan we'll be looking at the relationship between United States and China okay so this is relevant to your lives because you'll be you will eventually have to work and live in this really screwed up world that we live in okay and the third benefit is once you understand the game you will have predictive powers you'll be able to understand how the world will develop you'll be able to analyze your own life and understand how you will develop and that gives you control sovereignty over your own destiny okay that's my promise to you if you actually spend the time to listen carefully in class to participate fully to follow the news uh and you spend the entire semester doing so then these three benefits will start to acrue in you okay this is a lifelong struggle to learn game theory i'm a lot older than you are i have a lot more experience than you okay but I want to show you how to look at the world through game theory another phrase that you you learn in school is I'm going to teach you how to think critically about the world or I'll just teach you how to think okay all right are we clear any questions before I move on all right so this is all very abstract and so what what I'm going to do now is I'm going to use an example of a game to show you how game theory works okay all right so let's let's use a really simple game okay let's imagine there are five boys and five girls and they want to get married okay so these are the players and what we're going to do is we're going to divide up them up into male and female then what we're going to do is we will rank the males and the females okay okay so we're going to rank 10 players and to five 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 okay and so how do we rank them well we rank them according to their attractiveness using three criteria uh the first is genes the second is wealth and the third is status okay so genes is very simple it means that you're good-looking it means you're tall it means you're healthy you you will live a long time okay genes is pretty simple to understand wealth just means that you or your family have a lot of money status means that you have a lot of friends you have a high status job you come from a really powerful family okay so these are the three criteria that we can use to judge a person's attractiveness and then what we can do is rank them from five to one five means really the best one means the worst okay and we can rank all 10 according to these metrics so according to biology what we call evolution biology or ev evolution psychology we're always trying to find the best genes to procreate because this ensures that our genes pass on okay so um remember that men have a penis which they can stick into anything women have to give birth so the strategies are different okay so basically five number five is trying to have sex with all five women right that's his strategy um but fear one number five wants to ensure that she only gets five okay so these are different strategies and if this according to evidence psychology all five of these females should try to procreate with number five okay but we know you can't do this and suicidal why is it suicidal because the human rights couldn't survive right it'd be idiotic to do something like this where all five women are just trying to marry this one guy and maybe him okay but these three are eliminated because then your society would collapse you wouldn't you can have that many children so this can't possibly be true right so let's figure out what rationally what should happen okay all right so let's think about this rationally or from an e economics perspective all right so again number five he's trying to maximize the game so he's trying to sleep with all five women okay the problem if he does that is these five know they're all being played and they recognize that this guy is probably an asshole so five the best woman is like you know what there's not much of difference between four and five so I'll just go marry this guy right so number four is gone and number four is like you know what five is probably making a good decision so I'll just go marry number three right and then what happens now is that five by trying to marry all the women is stuck with the worst choice right so that's kind of stupid for him he's stuck with number one but guess what if any of these guys try this crap the same thing happens to him where four is like you know what i I can't get five but I'll but I'll try to get four and three together and then three is like screw you i'm I'm going to go and marry two four is going to marry three okay then he's stuck with one as well or he's just alone so if they try to individually maximize their outcome they all get screwed in the end so the only way out out of this is if they cooperate okay and the best way to cooperate is basically five is like you know what screw this i'm not going to go after four or three i'll just I'll just have my five okay right four is like yeah I'll just go marry four no dating no games i'll just go marry four and three marries three two marries two and one marries one okay and the world now is perfect everyone has a husband and a wife and they can now just have children and the world is perfect and this is actually the best strategy for all the players right we call this the wording game theory we call we use for this is called the Nash equilibrium okay nash equilibrium just means that you always reach a state in which all the players maximize their outcome the Nash equilibrium and so the world makes sense now there's a problem with this though the problem is in real life no one does this okay in real life no one actually follows this rule natural living is just a theory we made up but in real life that's just not what happens what happens in real life is we choose to be suicidal okay so let me tell you about a game I played so last year I was teaching this class and I asked the boys and I asked the girls pretend you're now 30 years old right your parents are pestering you to get married and you've been on the dating market for 10 years there's really no one that you think is perfect for you you've just you you've have basically give up on love imagine that you want to get married now and tell me what is the minimum requirement you need in order to agree to marry someone else okay what's the minimum okay and then I have the boys and the girls write down response the boys were pretty simple right well you know as long as she likes me and as long as I can put her my penis into her I'm good okay it's that simple okay it really is guys are like "Yeah I'll settle for anything that's the That's the boys right?" Girls were different girls who were like "Okay if I don't love him if I'm not even attracted to him I need about a million dollars a month." Really oh my god yeah i need about a million dollars last class last semester okay all right so this makes no sense right so in theory in theory we should follow Nash equilibrium but in real life what happens is this all the girls want this one guy okay and maybe number four look at them for number four but 321 they don't want and we know because just look at the world around you look at these billionaires right like Ellen Mus how many wives does does he have how many children does he have right all the women in the world many not all but many just want to marry actors like Brad Pitt billionaires like Ellen Musk right and 3 two and one they what do they do well they watch Netflix they watch porn they play video games they've given up on life okay they're like "We don't care." We call these people incels right involuntary celibates because basically they have given up on life and life has given up on them so this entire competition is between number five and four for all the women in the world and this is again suicidal this will lead to the death of humanity and the question now is okay why are we suicidal and so let's look at game three analysis right the players the rules and incentives we know we know what the players are the players are doing stupid things the rules we know okay but incentives is something that we have to think about why are they behaving like this and the answer is because they're not interested in sex or procaration what they're interested in is status okay that's the game they're playing status i don't want to marry someone to have children i want to marry someone so I can take a picture of her and post it on Instagram so I can get a lot of likes oh my god i want to marry someone so I can walk with her in the mall and all the guys are jealous i want to marry someone who I can brag about okay it's it's a game about status not a game about sex or procreation do you understand they are not people are not being rational here people are trying to maximize their status in life and that's why everyone's behaving like this number she may be the ugest woman in the world but she's still like you know what it's still my choice where not to have kids and having kids is a pain in the ass so if I'm if I'm going to make the sacrifice this guy better be good-looking okay or this guy better be rich otherwise why would I want to have kids okay so this is why people behave the way they do if you think about this way what you recognize is that people are rational but to understand why they're rational you have to figure out what the game is okay but then this leads to us to a question which is okay well clearly this is wrong because if we behave like this throughout human history we wouldn't be here today okay how is it that we have this game today and we're going to die but we must have come from somewhere we've been around for like a long time so how is it that humans have survived for so long doing these stupid things and the answer is basic game changes over time according to the superructure of society okay the superructure the superructure is what determines the nature of the game superructure just think about the big picture right how many people are there is somebody wealthy or poor are there enemies to this society okay this is the superructure the big picture demographics economics culture politics religion and these things together is what determines the nature of the game all right so let's look at three examples of superructure all right um example one is you have a low population society okay low population is like maybe 200 people 200 people okay a village basically they are poor and um low technology low technologies means they don't have access to clean water they don't know what hygiene is they don't understand what germs are so it's very easy for a woman to die in childbirth okay and um low competition low competition just means that there are no competing villages against them okay so that's one kind of superructure the early superructure of human society okay then you have maybe growing population okay so we're talking about like maybe 10,000 people 20,000 people they are now growing in wealth growing wealth um they have some technology meaning they have access to clean water and they have high competition okay meaning that they're competing against different villages and societies around them okay that's another superructure and the third superructure is overpopulation okay which is the world we live in today okay where in China you have a billion people that's a lot of people um too much wealth okay but with wealth you have inequality right and then you have high technology this high technology means that every woman who gives birth will not die and every child born will live on will live okay and then you have something called an equilibrium equilibrium just means that yeah there's competition but they're not going to go to war against each other the world is basically peaceful okay and according to super structure the game is going to change so let's go back to the game okay we have 10 people in a low population poor society guess what they're not going to date what they're going to do is they might get married but they're going to have sex with each other why because as a woman the only way to ensure that your child survives is if all the men in the village want to protect and nurture the child they will do that if they believe that the child could be theirs okay so the woman will maybe have a husband but the woman will also choose to sleep with other men to disguise paternity doesn't make sense so there's no dating there's just lots and lots of sex in order to maintain social cohesion okay now in a superructure number two there's no dating either why because this society is in competition with other societies and they need to have as many children as possible so what the the solution here is to arrange marriages arrange marriages where you know who cares who you marry just have lots and lots of kids okay there's no dating either just have lots and lots of kids you marry who your parents tell you to marry you marry someone that you know you marry your childhood best friend who cares okay but you marry someone you have lots and lots of kids okay that's super structure number two superst number three is the one we live in and here you have a dating game right because why because the odds of you obtaining status is really really low okay and the only way that you can change your status is by marrying up and that's why you have a dating game a dating game is opportunity for you to find someone better than your social demographic circumstance can suggest okay and that's why you have low uh decreasing uh fertility rate okay where over time because of the dating game society will collapse okay does that make sense all right so now you're the government and all around the world women who are wealthy well educated are refusing to have children especially in East Asia right now the fertility rate in China is about one okay about one the replacement rate that you need is a 2.1 so just to maintain your current population levels every woman in China needs to give birth to at least two kids but right now on average women are choosing to have one kid only in China and the worst thing is that this trend is increasing so 5 years ago the fertility rate was maybe 1.7 now it's one okay so the trend is very very negative okay so governments all around the world are trying to figure out what to do how do you convince women to have more kids and what we've discovered is it's impossible we can pay you more money like they do in South Korea guess what it doesn't work because people don't want money they want status and status is a zero- sum game okay money is infinite but status power is a zero sum game so when you have overpopulation when you have too many people competing for two status too few status positions you have decreasing fertility rates and there's nothing you can do about it the moment you give women choice they choose to improve their lives by marrying someone better okay not all but most and so over time what happens is your society collapses if you look at history the best indicator that a society is about to collapse is if the woman who are wealthy and well educated if they refuse to have children this is the same this is what happened to the Romans who collapsed this is what happened um to many empires this is what's happening around the world today in America in Britain in Europe in China okay and this tells us that society is collapsing so in other words what this really is okay these superructures it tells us the life cycle of a civilization right so this is when you when civilization is young then it mature it grows and then it collapses okay and if you look at history all civilizations go through this process of birth maturation and then collapse and there's no way around it so the power of game theory is that just by studying one aspect okay if I just study this game all right I figure out who the players are the rules and the incentives I can figure out what the super structure of the civilization is okay and then once I have these two I can now figure out where it came from and where it's going okay that's what I want to teach you in this class how to analyze a situation so you understand the players the rules and incentives which will give you insight into the superructure so that you can figure out where it came from and then you can also predict where it's going all right so but you can also look at the superructure and figure out what the game is being played okay so this is one example but but throughout the semester we'll be doing many many different examples of game theory is this clear so far are there any questions any comments any questions before I move on all right all right all right so let's just look at some basic facts okay all right all right this is a map of the world okay as you can see okay oh sorry so the color scheme is this the red is where the population uh the society has an above replacement fertility rate okay so above 2.1 if it's dark red like here in the middle of Africa it's six to seven or six above okay and why why is it that the case because Africa is in a situation where it is a growing society with middling tech so a lot of people die lots of competition so to survive families have to give birth to a lot of kids okay they have no choice in the matter but then you move to the rest of the world okay so this is um North America Europe and East Asia the three wealthiest parts of the world and guess what the fertility rate is collapsing because now we've entered the endgame where it is overpopulation too much wealth so too much inequality and so women are forced to pick the best possible mate or not have children at all all right and here the situation is very very dire north America and Europe are kind of okay why because immigration because even though their women are not having children they can choose to import people for their labor force but East Asia is really really screwed guys okay so just look at this region okay so China is one but the worst is North Korea sorry South Korea south Korea has the lowest population uh rate in sorry the lowest fertility rate in the world they're at between 0.6 to 0.8 so they're probably gone in 50 years time it's so bad that when you go to South Korea they have signs outside restaurants that says no dogs and no kids they think that kids are a problem okay so you look at the these areas again they are poorer so women are forced to have more children in order to survive okay but you look at wealthy areas well they'll probably be gone in 100 years time okay you it's total total collapse the solution the governments are choosing right now is to import immigrants okay especi So these are the trends right now and it's causing a lot of disruption in society because guess why guys people don't like outsiders people don't like immigrants but they don't have a choice of matter because along with the fertility crisis is the aging crisis where your population is getting older and older okay so life the world is not that simple if you want to know who will rule the world in 100 year time 100 years time just figure out which society in which society do wealthy educated women choose to have children and then that society will rule the world okay it's that simple right well unfortunately if you do it that way you get a really really disturbing answer okay so this is per capita G uh GDP okay so how much people people make all right so obviously if you're zero you're very poor and um if you move to over here you're very wealthy okay so United States is the wealthiest society in the world right sure we can understand that then this is the fertility rate which tells us how many children women have on average okay so again 2.1 is replacement rate okay 2.1 is replacement rate so United States is actually below replacement rate but the United States doesn't really care because it can import immigrants okay um China is probably around here somewhere somewhere okay um Angola is up here but it's poor so what this map tells us is a country that is most likely to be dominant for the next 50 years is this country Israel okay is it is the only wealthy western high-tech society in which women choose to have more than two kids okay this is what game theory teaches us and yeah I know there are people like "Yeah but Israel it's um it has 9 million people and um it's in the middle of a desert and everyone hates Israel i understand that thank you very much." Okay I understand that but if you just analyze how the game works okay if you just look at it objectively from a game theory perspective you are forced to conclude that Israel right now has the major advantage over everyone else now it is possible that societies will change the fertility rate as the as the world changes okay but I'm saying that given the current state of things Israel their growth trajectory is very very high but then the question then is okay why is it that Israel they are different from everyone else and the answer is because the world hates them okay because they think they are different from everyone else and they must unite together to survive so in Israel fertility is status okay if you are a woman and you give birth to a lot of kids that means that you love Israel that means that you are doing what you can in this war for survival it means you are a patriot okay um but this has to do with religion so what the west has done is not only um has it created a dating game where women can choose to have kids but the western world has also given up on religion and embraced materialism right so what is valued in our world in the west it's not patriotism or love of family or religious duty it's just how many Instagram followers you have it's how many YouTube subscribers you have it's how many how much money you have okay that's all that matters so given the current state of state of events it's very hard for the Western world and really for China to survive next for the next 50 years okay and I and I know like well China has a billion people so even though um you know we're only giving birth to 10 million kids a year which will still be around for a long long time okay so at this rate by 2100 China will be will be at a population about 600 million that's still a lot of people man um okay here's the problem though okay this is South Korea okay south Korea is like the worst case scenario and for South Korea this is actually the best case scenario where okay given current trends and let's let's just pretend that nothing bad happens to South Korea well by the year 2100 you you have a situation like this where the vast majority of people are over 65 and you have no kids okay that is a zombie society where no one works and everyone just I don't know walks around the park every day no one works so the economy has collapsed okay so look look look at this trend where we are now in here okay where the majority it's still a working population which is good you need that for the economy but by the time you hit 2040 okay you got this huge dependency and a creating population okay you you guys see this where we are in um Okay so we're at 2020 right okay all right so it's still not too bad but by the time you have 2040 look at this okay look at this m look at this where you have absolutely no kids and then you have lots and lots of retirees okay and then by the time you hit 60 oh my god right your population your working population has decreased by half by 50% all right so if things are stay the same if nothing happens South Korea will be will be dead in I don't know by 20 150 okay best case scenario but what we know from history is that societies will not die naturally eventually South Korea will be forced into wars new economic crisis so this trend will just increase and so if North Korea get got past 2080 I'd be very surprised okay I would be surprised by 2040 South Korea were to face collapse as a nation state okay because you need these people to work but guess what you also need them to fight wars so if North Korea ever threatens South Korea most of your adult population will be dead okay so South Korea cannot fight a war now the prospects for South Korea is utterly hopeless there's nothing South Korea can do about this because South Korea is an extremely materialistic society where the only way only way to get ahead is by making a lot of money okay and if you're a middle class person in South Korea it makes no sense for you to have three kids makes sense for you to have one kid and put all your resources into this one kid in the hopes that he passes the college examination gets in a good university and then gets a good job at Samsung which is the only company in South Korea okay Samsung right so the situation is pretty dire in South Korea all right okay that's it for today any questions guys about what we've learned okay yeah speaking of mic please so so for the last graph that uh we talked about Israel and I've noticed that the Saudi Arabia that is also like uh at uh have not bad GDP per capita and fertility rate so but for Saudi Arabia maybe I'm wrong like uh stereotypically that they didn't receive uh much hate as Israel so so why did they like at the similar position as Israel okay that's actually really good question okay all right so South Saudi Arabia as you can see from this map has it's a very wealthy society um and families have about 4K on average all right so South Saudi Arabia is actually an outlier and the reason why is that it gets all the money from oil revenues okay so it sells with oil around the world what what does it do it creates a welfare state using this oil um so you're incentivized to have um many children as possible because the government will pay for it free schooling free health care free housing and then a guaranteed job so it's basically like socialism uh it's also a Muslim country so you have this religious duty imperative to have have as many children as possible okay but the problem with Saudi Arabia is the idea of human capital where it is not really a Mar society in which people are well educated and they're contributing to the to the economy okay saudi Arabia just just gets all its money from oil and that's it it's trying to grow terrorism it's trying to develop its uh human capital but it doesn't really work okay so so you're right in that Saudi Arabia um it is uh it seems to be doing well but it's not really okay um but also like people will argue about Israel as well we're like well Israel gets all its money from the United States and it's the American military that supports Israel um that's true to a certain extent but I would argue that you actually go to Israel you will see that it's an open dynamic society in which you're allowed to ask questions which you're allowed to criticize the government uh in which you are given a lots of opportunities for social mobility okay so Israel has democracy it has uh innovation okay it has um um technology okay and Saudi Arabia doesn't have these things if you want to be a really strong nation then you need innovation you need openness you need you need technology okay it's also um really highly educated right okay does that make sense okay so Saudi Arabia is really an outlier here all right but the problem is what happens if Saudi Saud runs out of oil right or there's a war in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia is kind of screwed all right all right but you can also argue no well you know Saudi Arabia it has a lot of money and maybe Okay so so game theory doesn't give us the answers game theory we it just gives us a guide to ask questions and do research okay does that make sense uh yeah i have a question about I have a question about like when is this data it's it's rose about 2009 right so how about now did it change a lot or like is there anything change um okay okay yeah so you ask you asked about the sourcing of the data okay and you're right in that there there will be fluctuation okay but the um but this is 2024 okay 2024 and this is Israel right here okay all right so if it's red it's above replacement all right and if you just Google Israel population fertility rate Israel is the only wealthy nation in the world that has an above replacement fertility rate okay all right okay any any more questions guys all right great so I will see you guys next class
