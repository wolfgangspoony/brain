# Rise of Reactionary Politics

No more in the sudden relatively recent rise of the alt rate from like 2010 is because of Curtis Yarvan who is in total rando in the end this fringe movement of new reaction movement or the dark enlightenment and now Billionaires and a lot of people are subscribing to this idea like Peter Teal, Justin Fanz, Elon Musk and Mark and Dreson and it's kind of the driving force behind all the consolidation and power and billionaires trying to buy everything and us relying on private companies instead of government resources and we're going to be squeezed of every penny and personal freedom if it's just left unchecked. I hope you have a good day.
