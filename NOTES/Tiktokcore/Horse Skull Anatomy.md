# Horse Skull Anatomy

I have a question about T-Rex. I'm already positive it doesn't look like what we thought it looked like, but here's a big question. A horse skull looks like this. Yet the majestic horse, it, it looks like this.

And a dog skull, more carnivorous looking, but the dog looks like this, it has jowls, so... Why do we see this on the T-Rex and other carnivorous dinosaur? I assume it looks like this. Why can't the T-Rex have jowls?

Why didn't he look like this? That makes a lot more sense to me. Food for thought.
