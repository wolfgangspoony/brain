# Subway Surfers Brain - Split-Screen Attention Economy

The principles behind Subway Surfers Family Guy's split-screen sludge content were first pioneered by cable news on 9-11, September 11th, 2001. That's how it all got started. That's when they introduced the Kairan with constantly circulating text. In both cases, content creators stumbled upon a powerful hack for human attention while trying to do something else.

In the case of cable news and the Kairan at the bottom, it began as they needed to cover 9-11 constantly, but there were other things going on in the world that people also needed to know about, so they put that in text going in a ticker on the bottom. This had been used in news before for things like major weather events or disasters, but they kept it in place after 9-11 because it just was so effective for retaining viewers. In the case of family guy sludge content creators, they were trying to evade copyright by adding another video on top of the family guy video so they could post entire episodes without getting flagged or taken down, because whatever AI scanning TikTok for copyright infringement would say, oh, this is a video of soap being cut, or if someone telling a reddit story while chopping up a watermelon. The family guy sludge content started in late 2022 and into 2023.

There's a great no-your-me-marital tracing it by Owen Kerry, one of their best editors. But what happens as it gets more viral is the focus shifts away from the family guy episode or the subway surface footage and to the thing that's accompanying it. Chris Hayes, the MSNBC dude, describes this in his newest book The Sirens Call, which is a history of attention focusing on our contemporary era and the internet, and he talks about his own experience as a cable news anchor. So let me read you a piece of it.

He says, This meant that on the screen we had set up a competition between two alternate modes of keeping attention. The method of serial interruption represented by the crawl on the bottom and the method of holding attention through storytelling that I was attempting to execute on the top two thirds of the screen. It felt a bit odd to find myself in competition with my own screen to win the battle. This is the exact situation of those subway surface TikToks.

You divide the screen and on the top you have one form of attention that is more about listening to a story, you know, engaging your empathy, engaging your sense of like stakes and rationality. And at the bottom you have a screen that is like engaging your reptile brain, the reward stimulation, the visual soothing kind of effect, and Hayes goes on to say, the most successful forms of attention capture of our age, almost entirely circumvent the problem of holding voluntary attention, opting instead for an increasingly effective form of iteratively grabbing our attention over and over again. I call this the slot machine model. Anthropologist Natasha Dowshol in her landmark study addiction by design, machine gambling in Las Vegas theorizes that slot machines, which are like the most popular thing in any American casino or possibly worldwide, are addictive not because it's about the gambling and the rush of that, but because they put people in the machine zone where they're kind of in a trance.

Like she in this book goes out and interviews people who are disappointed at winning an slot machine because it interrupts this ability to just become totally egoless and pull the lever and watch the colors and the bright lights move. It hits the human brain in such a way that it's iteratively grabbing our attention over and over again and it's soothing us into this calm where we don't have to worry about anything. And that's the addictive part of this. slot machines aren't even gambling.

They're just over stimulation sludge. So much of digital content is built for that reptile side of our brain. It's rhythmic, it's sensory, stimulating, it's like ASMR, it's goop content. It's even like three, four hour long podcasts where you're kind of in this weird trance zone like state while you're doing something else.

And your brain is just occupied and numbed and you don't have to feel. It ticked talk itself, you know, this rhythmic process of going from video to video along an ever ending scroll and you're usually lying still and kind of relaxed. That's sort of a physical feeling. And it's something we don't analyze enough with the internet.

You know, we're always thinking about this stuff in terms of what are the ideas there, what are the messages, but we don't think about it in terms of physical sensation. And maybe we could analyze it, you know, the way we analyze dance. It's important to think about that physical side of media because it isn't just our brains that are engaged. It's our bodies, our eyes, our arms, our legs.

We're sitting in a certain way. We're feeling a certain kind of way inside of our bodies. And I was thinking about this as I was reading this book and I decided to try reading by candlelight, like people did in the old days to see if that, you know, made me feel differently. And I don't recommend it because I just ended up spilling candle wax all over the cover, knocked the candle over.

And you might be able to see it. I felt very messy doing it, but it kind of taught me, you know, there's no going backwards. There's no returning to tradition or putting the cat back into the back. We live with the media forms that we have.

And, you know, I might have this knee jerk reaction of being like, no, I don't want to watch the sludge content, but the only way out is through. And it's important to have media literacy to know what this stuff is doing to us and then be a responsible user of it, both as a consumer and as a producer.
