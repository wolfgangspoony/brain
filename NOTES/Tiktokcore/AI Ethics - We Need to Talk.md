# AI Ethics - We Need to Talk

We need to talk about AI because this shit isn't going away. Because like it or not, anti-chap GPT or not, the way things are looking, that shit's not going away. I am not trying to start shit. Let's just level with ourselves.

At the point where we are, actually fuck our point, AI is revolutionary. And when I say revolutionary, I'm saying that in making active comparisons to the revolutionary quality of the iPhone and the revolutionary quality of the internet. Why use case? Convenience.

Yes, there are huge environmental concerns. There are artistic concerns. Bitch, there are so many concerns, but here's the shitty part. There were a lot of concerns with the internet.

Bitch, there were a lot of concerns with the iPhone. A lot of people were very anti-internet. Where the fuck is the internet today? Still here to stay.

Where's the iPhone? I'm recording on one right here and I have my script right here. So yeah, they're here. As much as I hate this, the reality is that arguing against AI is pretty much equivalent to arguing against the internet in 1995.

Or arguing against smartphones in 2007 like Steve Balmer did. You can have your concerns, but once that ball gets rolling, once that can of warms is open, you cannot close it and AI is one of those. Holy shit, bitch. People are using this thing for therapy.

And with the cost of therapy procession nowadays, can you blame them? And not just that, but the therapy is effective. So effective that now there are ethical concerns over whether or not dead ass therapists, actual human therapists can use AI in their teleducks sessions. This is where we are and bitch, this is why God.

I swear to shit. The next step had better be regulation. You had better believe months ago. I was fuck AI, fuck AI.

And don't get me wrong. I still am. Fuck that shit. I wish they never opened that can of warms.

However, this is a civilization altering tool. If you were to sit back and say fuck this and not participate, you would be the equivalent of someone who said in the 90s, then motorola cell phones are okay. That's the farthest I'll go with technology. That internet, that's a stretch.

You'd be just like someone in 2007 who said, pages were already too much. Now they don't got me on a flip phone. That's the farthest I'll go talking about an iPhone. I got a computer in my desk.

The fuck I need a computer in my hand for. That's what you will sound like. And as much as I hate the fact that I'm arguing for this thing, I am arguing for it because this shit cannot be stopped at this point. And if it cannot be stopped, it makes sense to get on the pro-regulation side of it.

Bro, this is a notification that I received on my phone a few weeks ago. I want you to read this shit and decipher it. You can trade, send, or receive, dogging me today on coinbase. But I'm asking you in English, what does that mean?

What the fuck is that sentence? If you said that shit to a European village child in the 1700s, in the middle of the woods that night you would have been burned at stake, killed all because you decided to say a sentence. That resembles an incantation. Now you have to confess or burn off fuck, but lucky you, that sentence isn't an incantation.

That is a notification that was allowed to be disseminated through the app store to your phone, through an app that sells come coin and has all your bank account information. AI must be regulated. They didn't want to regulate blockchainship or cryptoship. And now you can buy yourself dog in me on coinbase.

Congrats. Yes, the inception of AI brings so many different issues, environmental ethical, artistic, the issue of people's faces and images being IP. Y'all just saw the writers strikes, the sag strikes. There are so many more issues that this technology is going to uncover.

And I personally think that it is too big to put back in the box from once it came. Therefore, interact with it so you can learn it and not be left behind. However, advocate for its regulation before you have to pay three come coins to see Grox AI rendered ass.
