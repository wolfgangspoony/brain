# Jock-Creep Theory of Fascism

If you want to understand the vibes of American politics right now, there's an essay you should read called The Jock Creep Theory of Fascism by John Gans. It was published a few years back, but it's still a banger, and there's just a tweet by Elon Musk that made me think of it. The Jock Creep Theory of Fascism argues that looking at European fascist movements in the 1930s, you can describe two strains of energy. There's the Jock energy, like Mussolini, where it's all about puffing at your chest, being hyper-masculine, and then there's the creep energy, which you see in people like Gerbels or Himmler, these sort of social outcast marginal types who have their weird niche theories and physically just look like creeps.

So looking at the current crop of people in charge of America, you have Jock Creep. Jock Creep. Jock? Definitely Creep.

Gans describes these as ideal types in the tradition of Max Weber, the German sociologists, and says the Jock douche ideal type proceeds in the world with confidence and the presumption of immediate physical domination, while the creep-loser ideal type has been thwarted some way and is therefore reflective and is resentful, a plotter, a schemer, and a fantasist dreaming up grand historical vistas of triumph or doom. Of course this relationship is symbiotic. The Jock needs the creep, because the creep is smart, and able to run things, and the creep needs the Jock because the Jock is strong and has like good chat energy that can help you know spread the message to the masses of fascism. And what fascinates me about this tweet that Elon Musk has quoted and said hits the bull's eye is that it makes the same comparison between like high school clicks and like political archetypes, and proudly proclaims that this is like you know the Chester math team and the Jocks have allied with us.

These guys see themselves as the smartest guys in the room, you know, they're arrogant losers who have been excluded from mainstream society because they're just too weird and they've turned inwards and created these dark interior fantasies, which if you think about what Elon Musk and a lot of the other tech brothers believe like if all the money wasn't behind it, that's the kind of thing that like the weird kid would scribble in his notebook and you'd be like and part of what makes our ideology so appealing is that all of us have a little bit of that creep inside of us, and when we're in conditions of frustration when society isn't working for most people, when they feel like their lives aren't at the average trajectory, that creep part gets louder. And what these guys do is they look at that anti-social creep part and say that's honorable, that's good, and here's the example of the Jocks who's with us to prove it to you, and they kind of go back on these outmoded forms of thinking and being, and that's where they draw their special sauce and their strength. If we notice one difference about the second administration versus the first, it's that you have a higher proportion of creep energy in the White House, I would argue. One point John Gans makes at the end of the essay, which is on his great sub-stack, unpopular front, is that the creep side of the equation is actually more dangerous than the Jocks side, and we see that in the difference between the brutal regime that existed in Italy and the even more brutal regime that existed in Germany at this time.

And so we should be very concerned about the creeps having the levers of power in their hands, and I think we should be very clear in calling these guys what they are, you know like Tim Walls called them weird, like they are weird. And I think a good place to start from when arguing against these guys is from that ground of like moral ethical, this guy's a creep, this guy's charges against him. These guys are not like us. That's where we have to start from, because if you're all like, oh they're violating the Constitution, or like, oh this is unprecedented, or the norms or whatever, that's not concrete to people.

What you need to show, what you need to get them to feel in their gut, and what many of us already do feel in our guts, is that there's something fishy and weird, and just sort of uncomfortable about these people, and that's what we got to highlight, that's what we got to vote against.
