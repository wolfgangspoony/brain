# Animal Farm 1954 - A Rewatch

I recently watched the 1954 animated animal farm movie for the first time. I had never seen it and sometimes you just need to watch a movie that's under 80 minutes. I learned two wild things from it. First of all, let me bring up the poster.

That was a fun poster, right? Cute. The thing that caught my attention is right at the bottom there. There's a poll quote from a review.

In a review that they found so nice that they needs to poll quote from it, put it on the poster to sell this movie animal farm based on the George Orwells book. So New York Daily News promises you that when you go to see animal farm, you will have the laugh of your life animal farm. So that's the first wild thing and I think that's just delightful. Second wild thing is how this movie got made.

You see after George Orwell's death, a couple of film executives went to visit the widow of Orwell to obtain the movie rights to animal farm. Which she sold under a condition. She wanted to meet her idol, Clark Gable and that was a range so that's cute. The film executives, however, were not film executives but were in fact undercover CIA agents.

You see the CIA was funding art specifically anti-communist propaganda art. As part of a psychological warfare workshop, that is what that was called that operation. Now I don't know if you'll think this depending on how much you know about this animated animal farm. But you may be wondering if you know just a little bit about it but not this story is that it's kind of a British production.

Why would it be a British production if the CIA funded and produced this movie specifically as anti-communist propaganda? Well you see, it was thought that American screenwriters and filmmakers could not be trusted to give this message considering the red scare going on through Hollywood. So they outsourced most of it to the UK. Now the guy who orchestrated all of this and I'll get to him in a second, he was quoted as saying that the script and the story were carefully edited and manipulated to really push forward an anti-communist message.

This includes making snowball, this is going to be for if you know animal, I'm not going to explain animal farm to you. But snowball, one of the pigs, they felt that he was presented a little too sympathetic so they took that down a little bit. So in early drafts of the script, snowball was presented as intelligent, dynamic, courageous and apparently a memo went out from the CIA producers saying that snowball should be presented as fanatical. Who, if his plan is carried through will be just as destructive as Napoleon's plan.

So they had to make them kind of one in the same. One of the other notes that the CIA wanted was a clear distinction between bad farmers and good farmers because not all farmers are bad. So it made sure that only Jones was shown as a bad farmer and the only other human antagonists in the movie are farm hands from Jones's farm. Other farmers are presented as sympathetic and against Jones, really judging Jones.

You know, to get that message a little closer to what they wanted to deliver to the American people. Besides, they were afraid that if you portray all farmers are bad, people in America who work in agriculture might be offended. They also wanted to show that not all animals were for the rebellion and even wanted an additional scene to show some animals not on board with rebelling. So all of the messages of animal farm get a little diluted to fit the anti-communist message that the CIA, remember the CIA wanted to make sure they put it to this animated animal farm movie.

The last notable change and perhaps the most noticeable change is the ending, where in this movie it has been changed that the animals successfully rebel against the pigs. Pigs don't join forces with humans anymore. Now it is just success, feel good message. We have defeated the evils of communism.

Now going back, I did mention I would bring up the guy who orchestrated this whole thing. Gentlemen by the name of E Howard Hunt. This was his psychological warfare workshop. He was in charge of finding these pieces of art he could fund to discourage communism in America.

E Howard Hunt, pretty significant guy as far as the CIA goes. You may know E Howard Hunt from his other projects like the US Regime Change in Latin America or the 1954 Guatemalan coup. Same year's animal farm came out. Also the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba.

The E Howard Hunt guy behind all of that. One of the last notable things from E Howard Hunt was his involvement is one of the burglars at Watergate, bugging Watergate. E Howard Hunt for which he eventually served 33 months in prison. He is responsible for this anti communism animal farm adaptation.

And when you think about all of this, it just feels like there should be a word that could describe these events. Perhaps a word kind of coined after a famous author. Off the Esk, I guess. Maybe not an author, maybe Lin Chi-in.

There's got to be a better word. I'm going to find it. I'm going to figure out what this word is. Besides that, the movie itself is fine.

Art is pretty good. Animation is nothing like a mid-level, mid-level Hanabar Barbaric cartoon. This is the pigs, the pigs especially. I don't know if it's just me.

They sound like Mickey Rooney and breakfast at Tiffany's, but with more pigs snorning. So that's my review of animal farm. But needless to say, I think I experienced the laugh of my life.
