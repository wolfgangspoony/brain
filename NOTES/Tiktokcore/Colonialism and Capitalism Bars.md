# Colonialism and Capitalism Bars

Hey, this my impression of America was a Pimp. I'm a Pimp name America and don't forget to say a Pimp name. Colonialism, my Pimp can't got me straight with capitalism on my pink rank. I mean, baby, don't you know this American dollar guy weighed on it?

If you wanted to crash, don't weigh it on it. Big bank, always say little bank. I got 401k on it. Gold reserves on my teeth, talking cheap hosts, talking about letting a dollar be.

I'll start cool in all these countries just to have them stay on it. White fur coat, navy blue slacks, blood stained red bottles from the US. They're not staying red bottles from stepping on a next give a check to the police. So they can do it next all that talk about equality.

You can y'all can put that shit to rest. I've been fucking folks over since the 18th century. Now we in the 21st, good Samaritan doing my dirty work is dirty by works. Have a folks working corners with a dirty skirt pull up on any minimum wage workers working at donkey brown cattle.

Like I act that ass is still asked for my money. Yeah, like a tape box out of barbershop. I need to cut off the top. See, baby, you just a hold of my minimum slave.

I mean, a minimum wage 15 by the hour tax breaks. Don't give you a break. Bitch, I said I need my money today and no, it won't go to the potholes on your road. But it's one of the biggest gang I'm owed.

I'm talking big truths with big news. How do you think I keep these other countries my host? Baby, I've been pimping since pimping with pimping. As the latest high been living, I made buffaloes my bitch.

Should they stop bitching? Andrew Jackson, Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump. That's just not chilling. Crafter from a hellfire of hatred and bigotry.

Look at my history. They just follow in my vision. All the same because baby, that's just a game. Ain't no fun.

And you winning your loss was set up from the beginning. And you host, they'll think capitalism will help you get like this pimping. A pimping remains a pimped by keeping his hose pain. A pimping remains a pimped by keeping you buses as tricks.

But look, here's the trick. You still think capitalism will help you get like this. Now tell me, yeah, we really think a pimped going to have power with his hose. Get rich.

Oh, baby, that's rich. Remember, as long as you on my street, you just my, and that's the thing about it. I won't let you think to that. Remember, you can get just like this.

I let you American dream about it. Brainwash a manipulator. Y'all don't start to sing about it. Y'all hard labor.

He's the roost on my caddy star spangled in banner. And man, I love to glean around it. Fight back, fight back. I don't need martial arts.

This martial law will show you my American desert eagle screams the loudest. And this money print is still going to burn. Interest race can't sink without it. Stop using our genocide, our money for genocide.

Yeah, bitch, I don't think about it. See, baby, while you protest for rent to get cheap, remember that my buddies on Wall Street still got to eat sorry. Now, sorry, but game is game was ever y'all lost is my game and you show lost a lot. That's why these pockets never drain.

So when you tell your grandkids why they pop an inkpader, how they ancestors wasn't slave or how they going to work tough for it. Nothing because living costs don't match living wage. Yeah, yeah. Remember to let them know who created the game.

A pimp named America. And don't forget to say a pimp name. You'll feel me nigga.
