# The Sun Explanation

So, word on the street is that shuman resonance was off the charts during the No Kings protest. So today, we're going to talk about what shuman resonance is. Over here we have the sun. Here, we have earth.

At its core is molten lava that's made up of, I think, mainly iron and nickel. So these elements are in this liquid form at the center of our earth and it moves. Shuman resonance is a measure of electric and magnetic energy. When there's an electric current, that generates a magnetic field.

So all this stuff moving at the core of the earth then generates a magnetic field that kind of protrudes out like this. That's how we're able to kind of defend ourselves from things like solar flares from the frickin sun that then kind of comes over here and affects the earth. Shuman resonance is usually like a really stable value. It's usually right around 7.83 hertz.

And so that means that for one cycle or our earth, it would take about seven wavelengths to get from the surface of the earth to kind of the outer ionosphere is what it's called. So we'll pretend that ionosphere is like right at the edge of this. So then from the surface of the earth to here, the frequency can cycle seven times. And that's exactly like the width of the cavity, the ionosphere creates between, yeah, the surface of the earth and this kind of invisible shield that exists around the globe.

Within that ionosphere, we have a lot of thunderstorm activity. We have a lot of lightning every second. There's a thousand different lightenables that are hitting the ground that are striking earth. So that electricity is shooting down.

It's generating a magnetic field. All of this activity on the surface of earth creates the 7.83 hertz frequency. So when we all get together for our protests and we're all collectively chanting and have the same agendas, it literally becomes magnetic because the equipment that's usually reading the human resonance can pick up on that energy. So it will literally like if we all started shouting from the surface of the earth, we all start yelling, we literally wash out anything that is normally coming through.

There was so much like collective energy, what we're basically running on electrical processes with our neurons firing from that electrical current. It creates a magnetic field. And so when we're all collectively doing the same thing at the same time, we have a such a strong like aura basically that begins to disrupt the baseline electromagnetic energy that is normally just like pulsing through the earth. We have so much power in the things that we say and where we put our energy towards.
