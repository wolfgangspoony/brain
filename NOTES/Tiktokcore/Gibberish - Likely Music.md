# Gibberish - Likely Music

So, we'reertas papala, easy, see some crotchala, little boob, a guy's got him And I'm gonna miss everybody out of row and close my gaze, look at the wild flag And playin' for dust, the night play to deep for beats Sad, let the lasak hate to be, tell me your feature to cease for their pleas Bear in there, bye, bye, bang, bang, bang, when you get gumball at the end God bless you, working on the plan to heaven, fire the Lord, all 24 seven days God is who we praise, even though the devils all love them a place But they keep it me safe, and in my place, safe grace to the gates of grace I'll change the face of jerks, till they get my soul booked Grills because there's no mercy for those, ooh, what can I do? It's all about the failure and how we grew Can I get a witness letting her fall, we living our lives, we turn our soul, yeah, yeah Yeah, and we're prayin', we're prayin', we're prayin', we're prayin' Every day, every day, every day, every day And we're prayin', we're prayin', we're prayin', we're prayin' Still will lace the... Now follow me, Roast, oh, weather is still a recipe, come let's go
