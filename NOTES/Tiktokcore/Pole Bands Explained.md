# Pole Bands Explained

Okay, let's get something completely clear. I am not secretly a stripper. This is a form of pole bands. I didn't learn it by accident.

And in order to be able to do stuff like this, you first need a pretty good grasp on things like this. So yes, I'm a pole dancer. I do shows, I've done competitions, I even teach. And every now and then I'll crack out the old leg quivers and risk my ankles to pay homage to the strippers and sex workers who built this hobby into what it is and who taught me how to do it.

But I don't work in a club and I don't have to deal with the prejudice and marginalization that the people who do face. So while I am a pole dancing I don't use the word stripper because I haven't earned it.
