# Current Events Commentary

I want to talk about something going on right now. So Timberlin, the legendary producer, is produced from Missy Elliott, Justin Timberlake, Crime Me A River. He's even produced a song, I'm on. He's been doing Twitch and TikTok live streams and charging independent artists to play their music, to showcase their music to his audience.

And he just announced that he signed an artist and AI artist, right? And so people are upset because they're like, did you train this AI artist on us real human beings and living in a real world, paying real bills and trying to express ourselves and put our passions out into the world? Did you train your AI on the artist? And this is his response on Instagram.

Come on, we're going to be a real man. Y'all crying about AI taking your spot, but your song's barely mixed. Why would we train it on that? You worried about AI stealing your sound?

Bro, you ain't got one. Like I said in the comment below, I'm not against new tech. I made a bag off of music NFTs, like a bag. But I never shitted on the people, the fans, who supported me that never messed with crypto, that didn't even believe in crypto.

I never shitted on them. I just got my bag from the people in crypto and kept pushing my music. Now here's another prominent industry figure who's responsible for a lot of major artists' success. Listen to how he's talking to people and the rhetoric he's using in regards to artists.

Yo, and in today's news of artists that never satisfy, artists that never have to. This is why executives produce this stuff for that nature don't work for artists. Our producers not artists are executives and people in the industry not failed artists from the past. And when I say failed, I mean like they gave up.

Him plus do you know how hard it is to push your artists? They gonna tell you how I wanna do that? Jimmy I've been famously told me one day get you something that don't talk back. When it's better than the AIRs that don't talk back and we're still mad at him.

Get you an artist who don't talk back. Think about that.
