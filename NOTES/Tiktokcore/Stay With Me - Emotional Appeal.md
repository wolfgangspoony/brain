# Stay With Me - Emotional Appeal

And then there's people that say no, you can't jump from the boy child is falling behind to World War Three. I understand where you're coming from but I need you to stick with me here. Just stick with me, just stick with me, give me three minutes. When enough boy kids fall out of the system, what does this mean?

It means that they cannot handle intellectually complex matters. Any time anything becomes intellectually complicated, they can't reason with it. And because they cannot be intellectually complex, they lack accountability. So these are the same boys who don't say and go through my comment section, you'll see it.

These are the same boys who don't say I didn't study, I didn't do well at school because I didn't study. I didn't make use of the opportunities that were given to me. I didn't handle my future correctly. No, they don't say that.

They say it's the government. They say it's the system. They say someone is planning that it creates and ass versus their mentality. There is a fundamental ingredient to war.

There is a fundamental ingredient to right wing or extreme left wing philosophy either way. And ass versus them who are the ass that ass are all the boy kids that have fallen out of the system. The them is everyone else who continued. It creates a mistrust and what do they do?

They start messing with conspiracy theories. You've heard it all the time. People who say no, they're at this flat. It's because the government, if enough boy kids fall out of the system, if at grade four, we have boys falling behind on the boy child force band because they cannot read.

Do you think he's going to be able to grasp a complicated matter? He won't. So he will avoid a complicated matter, not because he cannot grasp it or he doesn't have the toolkit to grasp it. He will avoid it and he will throw the blame back at the person giving the material by saying is the government.

These are the kinds of people who cannot fathom why we need vaccines. But instead of saying I don't understand this vaccine thing, they will say a vaccine is a government what what what. This is how an ass versus them system is created. Now let's look at how JD Vance, the vice president of the United States, came into power.

JD Vance wrote a book about poor white people who had fallen out of the system. They loved it. He under the mentorship of Peter Thiel thought that he was going to go for presidency. He didn't think that Donald Trump would president because he thought surely the people are going to see that this guy is not well in the head.

This guy is doesn't speak grammatical sentences. This guy is rude. This guy does not think things through. This guy is very simplistic.

That's what they thought because he had been under the mentorship of Peter Thiel for years, preparing him for this. But president Donald Trump won that election because when you're dealing with a group of people who cannot reason intellectually, they want simple things and simple things tend to be radical things. They want simple solutions now. If I had to tell you guys the solution to end the boy child falling behind is vote for this other political party.

There is nonsense. No issue is simple like that. Everything has complex layers that pour into it. So what these people who fall under the system want are simple answers.

And because they lack accountability, they often want charismatic leaders. So what J.D. Vance had to do to ensure that he gets somewhere into the presidency is changes campaign. He had to go from sensical, methodical to irrational, simple, one-word, unsolved, charismatic.

That's how he became vice president. Some people are going to catch on in the falling of the boy child. And the fact that this boy child is a conspiracy theorist. And the fact that this boy child wants simple things because he cannot grasp intellectual complex matters.

And they are going to be charismatic. And when leaders are charismatic, just know that the people who are following them cannot reason intellectually. I made an example of Hitler. And people say, oh, it's an emotionally charged argument.

I understand. But I need to understand how Hitler came into power. Hitler was not German. He was Austrian.

Right? So many had just lost World War I. The reparations, everything was destroying them. Their country was destroyed.

In that desperation of inflation and all of that, they needed someone who was charismatic. Because that's what happens in dire situations. People don't listen to the person that makes sense. They listen to the person who looks, who sounds like they know what they're talking about.

And this is my fear when the boy child continues to fail. That he will gather enough supporters who don't care about what leaders are talking about. He will gather enough supporters, more peers who don't care about complex matters. And they will want a leader.

A leader who won't complicate things. A leader who won't care about diplomacy, who's just going to say, it's not us, it's them. Think about what Donald Trump is doing. Donald Trump went to Kiddnap, a president of Venezuela and president.

Now say what you want about that president, right? But Venezuela is a sovereign country. You cannot just go and Kiddnap presidents. We took Israel to the international court.

If you have a problem with the country, take them to court, you cannot, we did not go and Kiddnap Benjamin Netanyahu. That is what Trump had to do. And do you know what the response is from the Republicans? Yes, that is how a leader.

Because if your leader is charismatic, he has to keep doing charismatic things and disregard diplomacy. And what happens when leaders disregard diplomacy? Chaos. And that chaos inevitably leads us to conflict.

It's because of Trump's actions that the vice president of Venezuela had to run to Putin. Now imagine if Putin was not a sensible man and he went back and said, I will protect Venezuela with everything I have. Isuille. Just because one person, Donald Trump, decided to be charismatic enough to go and Kiddnap another president and his supporters see nothing wrong with that.

That is the issue with the boy child falling behind. That he is going to lose the ability to think rationally and he will always think that solutions need to be charismatic. They need to be simple. They need to be fast paced.

And there will be a leader who is going to take advantage of that. And when he does, in order to keep his audience, in order to keep his support, he will keep having to do stupid things which will inevitably lead us to world war or conflicts.
