# ICE Raids and Camps

They're putting people in vans and bringing them to camps where have I seen this before? They're reading the spaces and they're hiding their faces, waging the new civil war. The people verse the government. But there's more of us than there are of them.

Dare you to try, dare you to look, dare you to pick up a fucking book, dare you to fight, dare you to scream, dare you to fight for your liberties?
