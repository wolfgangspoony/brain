# Casey Anthony's Return to Social Media

Casey Anthony making her second return to social media shocked me because it did not go over so well the first time. If you don't remember back in 2011, she started this video diaries and was ran off the internet. But since Casey has made her arrival, I just wanted to ask a few questions. On June 16, 2008, you and Kaylee left your parents' house and you told your parents you were going to stay with the nanny, Zanny, which is very interesting because a few hours later, you're seeing that blockbuster with Tony and he described hanging out with you during this time as you having a grand old time.

You went, you stayed with him, where was Kaylee? Two days after the last time anyone saw Kaylee, you went to your neighbor's house and asked for a shovel and I've always wondered what you needed it for. Four days after the last time we saw Kaylee and you were doing hot body contests, I can just see the grief on your face. It's palpable.

Two weeks later, you go to the tattoo parlor, the tattoo artist asked where Kaylee was because he knew her. So I don't even have to ask you this question because you answered him and said that she was with the nanny. And then you got a tattoo that means the beautiful life. When in all actuality at this time, you knew that Kaylee wasn't with the nanny.

So where was she? Oh, and let's not forget the shopping sprees you went on on your friend's dime except for your friend didn't know that they were paying for it because going on shopping sprees while stealing from people I supposedly love is exactly what I would do in my child's missing. One thing I've always wanted to know is how long you were gonna keep up the charade had you not been caught because 31 days after Kaylee was gone, everything blew up. You being the responsible person you were, left your vehicle somewhere and so your parents had to go pick it up.

This was after you ran out of gas and left your car multiple times. So your parents go and pick up your car and George, who was a police officer, he smells the non-forgettable scent of human decomposition. And then your mom sees Kaylee's favorite toy and her car seat in the vehicle. So your parents immediately thought, oh my God, something happened to Casey and Kaylee and they were half right.

And if you don't trust George's experiences or thoughts, when they took this car to the CSI lab, the people who worked there also said that they smelled human decop. People whose job is literally around that constantly and that's immediately what they smell before they even opened your car door. So you then take the cops on this endless goose chase and that's when they started looking at you as a suspect. And then you sent Tony a text message, I have literally never forgotten.

You said, if they don't find her, they will blame me and I will spend eternity in jail. You didn't say, oh my God, I hope they find her. I can't leave this as happening. I should have reported it sooner.

I was just trying to keep her safe, just some sort of excuse. No, you didn't do any of that. Same thing with the jail phone calls where you were constantly saying, my life is being ruined. I'm stuck in here.

Never, oh my God, I miss my daughter. This daughter and you're saying in your videos now, you wanna be the voice for the voiceless. This is where you need to start. And I've also always been curious, how embarrassed you were when you told the police you worked at Universal, so they took you down there to prove your employment.

You talked to the first person there and you say, yes, I do work here. Like I know I work here. So they say, oh, go talk to HR. You go to HR with the police and you sat there and waved at other employees like you knew them.

I have second hand embarrassment from just hearing about this story. They probably didn't face you because you have no shame. My opinion on that is proven by you coming back to social media to support the voiceless. Most of the world still remembers Kaylee and for the people who have forgotten or just don't know yet, I hope they see every single video that's been made about you.

It is not right that you can just come back and be this advocate. Who is advocating for Kaylee? I will never forget and I'll make sure as many people as I can reach don't either.
