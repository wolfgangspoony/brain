# Arch Nemesis Story

Brody told me I'm his arch nemesis. Thankfully for him. He didn't even crack by top six. DeCart got me so fucked up I stopped thinking.

Therefore I wasn't. Bell curved where I'm getting these hill figures. I'm not a bell. But I've been told.

Hydraulic press YouTube channel the way I press Iyer to these slimes. I have no ghost rider. I portended these bars under the influence of various controlled substances. I don't tote llamas.

But I did sneak an elephant into the Copa cabana. I don't sip walk. But I'm pouring up Ectoplasm in this Danny Fanna. Hold on.

Smart wool. I don't wrap it around the back this time. If you're wondering, I'm not saying a damn thing. Custom joint.

Vintage. Vans. Ralph Lauren on my jeans. New balance, WAM step in.

Casio. And of course. Tommy Hill figure chonies. But you already knew that didn't you.
