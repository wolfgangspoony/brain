# Series Experience

I can experience a series that a lot of the leftist in fighting nowadays is engineered by the CIA. Hold on and I'll explain. Let's take a look at this document that was just unclassified in 2008 from the CIA. All right, it's this document right here.

Simple sabotage field manual. Again, this was declassified in 2008. It's from the 40s and it's available on the CIA website so you could look at it yourself. But there are a couple very pertinent pages that I want to show you and tell me if it doesn't sound familiar.

All right, section 11 here. General interference with organizations and productions. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible and haggle over precise wording of communication, minutes, and resolutions. Hmm, and this is the kicker right here.

Insist on perfect work and relatively unimportant products. Tell me that doesn't sound familiar. I mean, a lot of the criticism behind leftist coalition building is this emphasis and need to want to be perfect. When perfection doesn't exist, right?

That's the whole idea that you build coalition with a bunch of groups of people. But that is like, leftists are allergic to doing that. At least leftists online. Like I just saw a video from another creator on here talking about how they're trying to build a mutual late network and their community.

Something to help feed the community to help build coalition. And they're having trouble finding a place to host them. And they ended up finding a place. You know where this place was?

A left-leaning church. A church that accepted gay congregation members. But a lot of the people who wanted to build this network had a problem with that. They had a problem that it was a church.

They didn't want to do anything with religion. And it's like, okay, so because you don't like religion, you're willing to just scrap this mutual late network. It's about this perfection, right? Again, the issue is with perfection.

And so many people in the comments were defending that. They were saying like, oh, well, you know, people have religious trauma. And it's like, okay, so because you have a problem with religion, you just want to not help out the community? Come on people, can't you see?

Now, we'll see if this video gets sent out that people need to see it. Or if it'll just end up in under 300 view jail. But yeah, we need to recognize and deemphasize this need for perfection and build coalition and community with people who we don't wouldn't normally do so with. That's the biggest takeaway here.
