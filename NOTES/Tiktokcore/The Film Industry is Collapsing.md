# The Film Industry is Collapsing

This is the current state of the film industry. Hey, so it looks like the studio is not going to buy your pitch, but I have good news. If you write it as a book, then they might be interested, but it's supposed to be a movie. But it could be a book.

If you write it, the whole thing, for free. You're saying that if it's the same pitch, the same story, but just expanded out to like 100,000 words, then there's no guarantee. But since it's IP, they will be more interested because it will have proved itself with an audience. But don't manuscripts that haven't been published yet get bought like all the time?

Yeah. But those haven't proved themselves by definition. So how are they getting bought? Because they're IP.

But how can something be IP if the public doesn't even know it exists? Don't worry about that. Just worry about this. IP equals money.

And if you don't want to write a whole novel, write it as a short story. That could work too. This doesn't make any sense. I had a 20-minute pitch for an entire movie.

Why wouldn't I just write a full-length script? A full-length screenplay? Nobody wants to read those. So just so I'm clear, you're saying to sell this movie, I have to write the movie in a completely different format.

Exactly.
