# Escaping NPD Abuse - A Cry for Help

I'm not in a safe place. I'm just recording this because I don't know what else to do. The NPD person runs his house and is not safe anymore. She's flipped and decided that I'm not the problem.

I don't know what the fuck to do. There are people involved that might help me. As of now, I really don't know what the fuck to do. My only priority is kidding out here.

I'm kidding out here. Yeah, I know where we're getting.
