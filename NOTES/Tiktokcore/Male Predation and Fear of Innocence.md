# Male Predation and Fear of Innocence

Men become predators because of their fear of their own innocence. When the ego learns at a young age that innocence equals potential death, it says, okay, we will do whatever we can to distance ourselves from innocence. That distancing becomes fear and then hate. A hate of our own innocence becomes a hate of other people's innocence.

That hate, when it gets bad enough, fearful enough, it becomes the destruction of innocence in yourself and in other people. This destruction is non-human. It goes against the will of creation of life. And when you step into that realm, that level of fear, you get swept away by pre-existing archetypal or collective complexes, gods, and these or demons, or whatever you want to call them.

These collective complexes take over the throne of the body of this predator. And they are no longer innocent. This search for power. If you find yourself wanting power, this includes seeking knowledge, seeking scientific grounding and consensus.

That's okay, but when that becomes or is fueled by the fear of not knowing of innocence, we're off to a bad start. So when you have a whole collective zeitgeist of fear of innocence, this is what you get. And the only way forward is for me as an individual to set aside the judgment of my own innocence, my own madness, my stupidity, my naivety, and to like I had a child, protect it. Say, you deserve to exist, and I will protect you.

Against the energies that seek to destroy it. They will eventually destroy the very playground. Nope, no pun intended, that they're playing it. I didn't like that.
