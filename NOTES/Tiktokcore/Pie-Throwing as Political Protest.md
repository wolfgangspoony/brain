# Pie-Throwing as Political Protest

The act of throwing a pie in the face of figures of authority is a public humiliation ritual that must toe a very delicate balance between chaos and order and order for the proper response to be elicited. This is a practice that Harkins back to the days of the court jester or the royal full who is a protected figure who is able to openly mock or criticize the king without fear of retribution. Maybe you've had a schoolteacher or a principal or a boss who has allowed you to throw a pie in their face at some sort of event. This is to let off some steam but it can go sideways very quickly.

My girlfriend and I were watching this Cody Kovideo where this kid throws a pie at his teacher or his principal and the principal gets upset because he threw the pie with excessive force. This got me thinking there are a lot of factors that go into the art of the perfect pie throw. You see the pie throw can really go one of three ways. In the first instance we have what we're going to call the pie smush.

This is where you take the pie and you place it slowly onto the person's face. Maybe you make eye contact with them and it's kind of weird. You like smush the pie around. This is going to elicit a disgust response from the audience.

This is because ontologically the pie itself has remained food. It has not turned into a projectile or an object of any sort. Nobody likes this one. It's not funny.

If anything it's kind of gross and you've really only humiliated yourself. On the other end of the spectrum we have what we're going to call the pie punch or the pie slap. This is where you take the pie and you throw it with excessive force at the person's face but your hand never leaves the pie. Now what you have done here is you have ontologically transformed the pie into an extension of your own hand and you have really just slapped or punched the figure of authority that you are attempting to humiliate.

When done with enough force this is going to elicit a fear response from the audience as they're going to worry for the person's safety. Maybe you could have broken their nose or hurt them in some way. You are very clearly just taking out your pent-up rage and taking it out on this authority figure. You're not really humiliating them in any way.

Now if we're to factor in Aristotle's rule of the golden mean we must strike a delicate balance in the middle between two excesses. This is what we're going to call the pie throw. This is where you take the pie. You launch it at the person's face but just before the moment of contact you release.

Your hand never makes contact. The pie lands on the person's face and everybody laughs. It's hilarious because the pie has ontologically become an object, a projectile. You have put the king or the authority figure in no harm and it's hardly food that lands on the person's face.

You have now just metaphysically achieved the art of the perfect pie throw. Everybody laughs. The king is humiliated and your honor and your valor is restored.
