# Stop Relitigating

All the posts that are taking this moment to relitigate the 2024 election and be like, why didn't you all just vote for Kamala, we wouldn't be in this situation. They give off the exact same energy as Bernie Sanders and like progressives being like, this is Netanyahu's war against Gaza. Netanyahu is the problem. Like you're watching in this moment, leadership and media from across the American duopoly practically crowing with glee because they finally achieved their 30 year goal to bomb Iran and you're acting like Kamala Harris whose defining characteristic is being a pushover to consultants and democratic leadership would be like significantly different on this.

Like no, just like Israel's genocide is not the fault of one man's corruption, but rather the culmination of a deeply sick society. This is what America is. Acting otherwise and taking this moment as an opportunity to whitewash the fucking Democrats of all things is the most childish thing that you can do. It is the political equivalent of thinking that the stripper actually likes you.

Like, grow up.
