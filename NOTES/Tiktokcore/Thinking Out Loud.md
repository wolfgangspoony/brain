# Thinking Out Loud

So, I was trying to think of the best way to show you what 30 seconds in the mind of a person with ADHD is like. So I went ahead and asked AI to create or replicate in words and in its perception, all the thoughts that go through a person's mind with ADHD in 30 seconds and to create it in the dialogue. I am now going to go ahead and take the dialogue that it created and place it into a voice synthesizer. So we can hear what it sounds like if a person were to have ADHD what it sounds like in their brain.

Now again, this is for entertainment purposes only, but this actually reading it, I'm like, yeah, this is kind of like what goes on through my brain. Okay, focus. I need to finish this report. Wait, did I send that email?

I should check. No no, focus. Report. Right.

Ah, this font is weird. Maybe I should change it. But first, coffee. Did I already have coffee today?

I can't remember. Oh, my phone buzzed. Was that a text? Should I check?

No, ignore it. Focus. Report. Deadline.

Oh, I forgot to water the plants. I'll do it after this paragraph. Wait, what was I saying? Oh, yeah, the report.

But first, let me Google that thing I thought about earlier. What was it again? Oh, right. The new podcast.

I should listen to that later. Wait, what was I doing? Oh, the report. Focus.

Okay, breathe. Start typing. Why is it so quiet? Maybe I should play music.

But what if it distracts me? I'm so behind. Why can't I just focus? Okay, one sentence.

Just one sentence. I can do this. Wait, did I pay that bill? So if you're a normal functioning person that does not have ADHD, this is what it is in the mind of a person with ADHD.
