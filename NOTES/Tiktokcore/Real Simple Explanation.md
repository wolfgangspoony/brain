# Real Simple Explanation

So recently had this song go viral and it's me singing about what I think Jubilee looks like The premise is you know when the Lord comes back But really it's just me saying that this is what this is what I won't for the world This is what I'm setting my moral and political imagination towards pursuing right? I it's real simple right? It's just I won't freedom for people and not the kind of paper thin notion of freedom that we got in America But I mean freedom that says you're belly's full and there's no cops on your back But what's interesting to me is that we all most of the engagement has been been positive There are some people that feel this way You know and babe, I just Huh it is so fascinating I mean the highest achievement of a person's cosmology which for a lot of Christians is Jesus coming back right the ultimate fulfillment and end of history you can't do any bigger than this The world is gonna just look like it has been trapped in the amber of Victorian era ethics And the one thing that we cannot challenge is contemporary men's fashion They I'm not a Bible scholar, but I'm willing to bet that that that jorts and jeans are not mentioned in the Bible Anywhere that when people talk about the end of the world in a good or bad way Jeans aren't mentioned now Dan McClellan could skidch me and tell me I'm wrong, but I'm willing to bet that the thing that That is that is coming at the end of the world is not whether or not you're wearing one big loop around your legs Or you got two separate loops that are conjoined at the top the thing is that so many people when they imagine the ultimate fulfillment of the world so many Christians in the US when they imagine the ultimate fulfillment of the entire universe of In their cosmology the entire project and story of the universe ends on this They cannot imagine it with anything other than the ultimate ascent of all of their most American suburban values They did you can't imagine fulfillment and freedom and liberation beyond the world the very limited world that you know then you're not a Religionist you're not a Christian you're a nationalist That's all that is and you've used that language to just project whatever you want on to it And you don't think God's anything more than a giant projector screen for all of your suburban country music song whistle and Dixie nonsense I can't say this they're in American flag and the Bible don't have nothing to say about the United States of America in the project that we Have here and in whatever religion and whatever cosmology you're in whatever Jubilee looks like to you whatever liberation looks like to you Whatever fulfillment looks like to you. I promise you it involves peace and it involves well-being and so I know that the US will not be the main agent Of our fulfillment at some point you can't be the ones to think that you're gonna start the forever war the forever work The forever hunger and then also think that you're gonna be the arborist ultimate peace and ultimate fulfillment I'm sorry babe
