# Sharks and Steak Metaphor

Throw a steak off the yard to a pool full of sharks. He'll take it. Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis. He'll make it.

Take the gratitude from him. A bit'll show you something. Whoa. Look, I chippin' a little bit of nothin'.

I chippin' a little bit of nothin'. I chippin' a little bit of nothin'. I chippin' a little bit of nothin'. Then throw the blower in his lap, walk myself to the court.

Like, yeah, I did that. X-rated. Johnny don't wanna go to school, no, mo. Why?

Johnny said books saying, cool, no, mo. Man. Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin. Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'.

God bless America. You know we all love him. Yesterday I got a call like from my dog, like 101. Say they killed his only son because of insufficient funds.

He was sobbing, he was mopping way belligerin and drunk, talkin' out his head, philosophy on what the Lord had done. He said, Kate, I can't you pray for me. It's been a day for me. I noted you're anointed.

Show me how to overcome. He was lookin' for some closure. Hopin' I could bring him closer to the spiritual, my spirit. I'm not better but I told him I can't sugarcoat the answer for you.

This is how I feel. If somebody killed my son, I mean somebody get killed. Tell me what you do for love. Loyalty and passion of all the memories collected.

Moments you could never touch. I'll wait in front of the spot and watch him hit his block. I'll catch him, leave him service if that's all I got. I'll chupin' then throw the blower in his lap, walk myself to the court like, yeah, I did that.

Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward. I can't even keep the peace. Don't you want hours? It'd be murder in the street.

It'd be bodies in the hour. He got a burby on the street. Paramedics on the dial. Let somebody touch my mama, touch my assistant, touch my woman, touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother.

You should chip up then throw the blower in his lap, matter of fact, I'm about to speak it. This convention call you back. All right, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control. Pray for me.

Man, what? Go listen to. They eat the body high.
