# Figuring Things Out

Alright, so I've been trying to figure out how to have this fucking discourse for a while now. Without it becoming completely unhinged. And it may still come unhinged, but I think that I finally found a way to do it, right? Boy oh boy, I sure do love ruin in my own fucking day.

Alright, so I want to tell you all two stories. And I promise this will make sense. So here's the first story. A year or so ago, I was out at the save a lot.

You ever been to a save a lot? Save a lot is the cheap trashy people grocery store that has the best mountain do substitute I've ever tasted. Now I am at this grocery store. And if you've ever been to a save a lot, you know that there is only ever one aisle open.

And half the time there ain't nobody up there when you first walk up. And as I am waiting for the cashier to come back from stocking shelves, there is a guy behind me. And he says the words, I bout to beat up one of them, Trains Gendard's the other day. And I as a transgendered, I'm sitting there and I'm like, oh shit.

And I'm just trying to lay low, get my three and a half pounds of ground beef, and get the fuck out of there. Now this man is talking to, I think probably his wife, his girlfriend, something like that. And she says, Ralph, you can't talk about them people that way. Ralph, they're just trying to get by like you and me.

And the man says, Rosie, I ain't mad at him for wearing high heels. I'm mad because he stole my catalytic converter. If you steal my catalytic converter, you're getting your ass beat. Male, female, or something else.

And at that moment, I breathe the sigh of relief. Also, I never found out who that queen was, but she is iconic. Girls out here stealing catalytic converters in platform heels. All right, so we got that story.

Also, I changed the names that I don't remember their names in that story. I am paraphrasing, but anyway, so we got that story. I'm gonna tell you another one. I had an old boss and man oh man, she knew how to be fucking woke, right?

She knew all the buzzwords. We had little pronouns circles. She had her little ally pin, you know? This woman thought she was God's number one gift to the queer community.

And if you had talked to her, you may have thought that too. Until one day, I realized this woman was incredibly bad at her job and that I was going to need to file a report. And boy, howdy, when I did that, the gloves came off. Suddenly, she was crying the biggest of white woman tears, telling me how terrifying I was.

And listing off every stereotype about trans people and neurodivergent people known to man. Now, let me ask you, which of those people do you think I'd rather have my back in all of this? If I had to choose between the two, who would I call up if shit hit the fan? Would it be the woman who knew all the right words?

Who knew all the right things to say? Or would it be that couple in the save lot? Who obviously didn't know shit about trans people? But was for better or worse, treating us like everyone else.

I know who I'd rather have on my side. I don't think a lot of y'all have come to terms with the brave new world we find ourselves in, okay? I made a little joke yesterday about how we don't live in the free marketplace of ideas anymore. We live in the arena.

And that was a joke, but also it's kind of true. And I need you to fully understand something, okay? We're in some deep shit. At best, we are probably going to be looking at another great depression.

At worst, a lot of people are going to fucking die. Or a lot of people are going to end up in prison. And with a cookie, y'all going to do when the prison guard calls you the F-slam. Are y'all going to be like, that is very homophobic.

I mean, no, not if you don't want your assholes turned inside out. And I'll be real, those of you who are still out here picking at semantics like this, like y'all are with fucking Jasmine Crocket right now. It does not make me trust you more. It makes me trust you less, because it makes me feel like you don't have your priority straight.

Y'all are going to have to stop caring as much what words people say and start caring a whole hell of a lot more about what vibes people are putting down. Because I assure you that like 90% of this country is running on vibes. It no longer matters what arguments you make. It no longer matters how morally or ethically or logically sound you are.

We are not in the free marketplace of ideas. We are in the arena. And some of y'all need to start realizing this or you are not going to survive. And you are going to be a detriment to everyone around you.

Because people are not going to put up with that. In real life, activism, they're not going to put up with that. You're going to be seen as a tactless loose cannon who is going to get everyone killed. A lot of y'all are going to need to learn that the world is a lot more crazy and a lot more nuanced than you thought it was.

And that knowing the right words and being decent are very much two different skill sets. You're going to come across people in this life who do not and may never get it all right. But they are going to have your back. And you're going to find other people in this world who know how to say all the right words.

They've memorized the whole damn list and they keep up with it. But when push comes to shove, they will throw you under the bus. As it turns out, knowing all this language is actually kind of a really bad way to determine whether or not someone's a good person. Sometimes it's not that they're wrong.

It's just that they're an asshole. And like I said, we exist in the arena now. Y'all are going to have to start acting like that.
