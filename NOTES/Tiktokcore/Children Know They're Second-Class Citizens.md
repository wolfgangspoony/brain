# Children Know They're Second-Class Citizens

Children know that they are second-class citizens. They might not have the words to articulate it, but they know. And people forget that children are sponges and that they are learning just as much if not more from what you don't say as they are from what you are telling them. Again, they might not have the words for it, but children know that they're smaller than everybody else.

They know that they know what's going on less than everybody else. They know that things that are hard for them are easier for adults. So when you treat a child like a second-class citizen, when you treat a child as though they are somehow less than human because they're young, because they're small. What you're doing is you are teaching that child, that people who are younger, people who are smaller, people who are disabled, deserve to be treated as less than human.

They don't forget this. This lesson that you inadvertently taught them goes into their long-term memory. And what they do is they say to themselves, okay, well, I will be treated as a human when I reach a certain height, when I reach a certain age, when I'm no longer this vulnerable. And then they repeat the cycle because they've learned that you treat people who are younger, who are smaller, who are disabled, who are vulnerable as second-class citizens.

The fastest way to heal society is to start treating children like people.
