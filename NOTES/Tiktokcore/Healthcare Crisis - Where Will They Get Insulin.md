# Healthcare Crisis - Where Will They Get Insulin

So just yesterday I saw somebody ask a really good question in response to a potential revolution in America. They wanted to know where would they get their insulin from. And I really feel like we need to continue to ask questions like that as well as answer them if we really want any change in this country. So let's take a step back.

I believe a lot of people have the idea of revolution looking something like this. Or maybe you see something like this when you think about revolution. And yes, this could be part of a revolution. But I really believe a successful revolution has multiple fronts.

So in addition to this being part of revolution, we could also have this right here. And we could have this right here. And we could have this. Have you all seen the whitest kids you know this is going to go over a lot of people's heads.

Okay, but what am I getting at exactly? In this very individualistic hyper capitalist world that we live in, building community is revolutionary. So to answer the question at the beginning of the video, where would you get your insulin from? It would come from your community.

And if not your community, a community connected to yours in another city, if not in another city, another state. And if it's not in another state, it'll come from Mexico or Canada. But let me take a step back because I understand just how disingenuous that answer came off. Right.

I should be giving you an exact company. I should be telling you an Eli Lilly or a novel Nordisk as where you should be getting your insulin from. But that answer was more of a blanket statement for where we would get all of our needs from, where we would get our insulin, glasses, food, clothing, it would come from community. It would have to start with community.
