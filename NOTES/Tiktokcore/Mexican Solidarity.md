# Mexican Solidarity

y'all actually like I gotta like every Mexican to stand up for our collective rights I don't like some of them AND? Oh there's like a Hispanic dude in California saying the end word right now yeah fuck that guy there's a 10 year old in foster care about to be thrown into a fucking cell it's collective justice I don't have to like all of them for them to deserve basic rights and I'm smarter to know everything affects each other there's no version where we get to be safe us and they don't and also acting like some of them aren't us I know blackpops like no come on man they keep it real
