# How to Protest Like the French

Okay great, so we've protested, we've got people's attentions, but we can't stop here, we have to keep building the pressure. I'm about to share a video from Weinstein Caroline on Instagram, she doesn't have TikTok, so make sure to watch the video all the way through, like comment share so that the message will get out and we can keep making waves. Well to protest like the French, a quick guide protest that actually work. First, know this.

French protests are effective because they're annoying. They make daily life unbearable. The economy bleeds. People are inconvenienced, that's the point.

That is leverage. Here's how they do it. Join a collective, unions, strike committees, neighborhood groups. The French know that every man is not for himself.

Disrupt daily life, no buses, no trash pickup, no flights, no teachers, no school. If it's crucial to daily life, paralyze it. Block infrastructure, think tractors, clogging up city streets and blocking freeways, all rail lines, blockade, ports, shut down airports. If it moves, people and goods shut it down.

This will hit them in the pocket. Imagine if even a fraction of Maryland's farmers showed up in their agricultural vehicles before the tanks for, you know, who's Nuremberg rallies this weekend. Occupy meaningful spaces, factories, campuses, public squares, pal, American flip sports, try stadiums. Pick places that will have an economic impact.

The French know how to coordinate the cross sectors. The teachers are striking at the same time as the bus drivers. This is about solidarity and collective action. And keep going, the pressure has got to mount and that can take weeks or even months.

And of course, if all else fails.
