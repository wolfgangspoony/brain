# Fear Expression

Oh man I'm scared. It's okay. Oh wow! Oh wow!

Oh my god. So here's a thing, it's three levels. The first is physical. Like you hold your hand up.

You can read the writing on your shirt. Oh wow. But the second level is that if you look in your eyes, they work properly this way. They communicate.

Oh wow. Whoa. That's crazy. Wait what are you doing?

I don't want to hug it. It doesn't go away. No that's incredible. It's like I'm like talking to myself.

Of course come over here to the side. You switch to your eye. I would have thought that was a great choice. Whoa.

But stay in the side. When you make eye contact this way, notice how in about five seconds or so, there's nothing in your eyes anymore. Is this just here or is someone put on your shirt? This is just basically how you've always seen yourself.

And your expression is kind of a fleeting. And then you're left with just more of a mask. This is going on for everyone. It's weird.

And the key expression that doesn't work back with is your smile. Do you see how your eyes are not carrying it? Yeah. There's here.

Wow. Our expression is so much richer. Wow. And that light is the light you're actually communicating with.

That is so cool. And this is the person who help people see. Wow. I love that.

Thank you so much.
