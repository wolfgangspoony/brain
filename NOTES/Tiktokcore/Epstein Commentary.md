# Epstein Commentary

Puh, Jeffrey Epstein. I don't know who that man is. But I would love to get a photo with him. I'm sorry, who's here?

Jeffrey Epstein? The man with the evil island? I've heard some very bad things. Would he take a photo with me, though?

No, sorry, I can't make it tonight. I have dinner with this. Mysterious man who I've never heard of before yet, I'm giving my time to... Jeffrey Epstein, have you heard of him?

We will be taking a photo together. Yes, I do run a giant tech corporation and I take it very seriously. But if 90% of my time is not spent taking photos with Jeffrey Epstein... Now what is it all for?

I just want to make it clear, though, that I do not know who... No one knows who this man is. But we all need to get a photo with him for some goddamn reason. I'm sorry, what's her name?

Gisley Maxwell? I don't know who that is, but her name starts with Gis, so... Get her in the photo, huh?
