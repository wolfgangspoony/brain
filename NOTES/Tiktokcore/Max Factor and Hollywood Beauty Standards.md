# Max Factor and Hollywood Beauty Standards

So during the Great Depression, everything in the beauty industry went down. Like everything except one thing went up so much, became a staple, infamous, made Max. I don't know his name, but it was Max Factor, the guy that made Max Factor, Red Lipstick, made that man set for life and also made Red Lipstick a thing. Hear me out.

Potmart is our Red Lipstick. Everything is going to shit right now. But you know what I can afford? A love boo boo.

I mean, that's what I, how I see it. I see the Chachkes, the Pokemon. It's, it's, it's the, the small trinket of dopamine. It's the little taste of happiness.

I can't have what I really want, which is peace, so I, but I can have a little la boo boo. But yeah, it's also really interesting to look up Red Lipstick, the history of Red Lipstick.
