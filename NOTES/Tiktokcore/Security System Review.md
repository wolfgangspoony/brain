# Security System Review

Okay, I think this is my favorite demonstration of a backdoor AI model. I'm going to turn this over to Kazmir, who's going to explain exactly how this works. I'm Kazmir. I'm the director of security research at Hidden Layer.

But what we have here is we have a yellow vision model. And the yellow vision models are on a lot of security cameras. It will alert you if there's anybody walking or a package. And the concept here is that it's backdoored, so that if a cup is present at the same time, you completely disappear from the camera.

So I could now walk up and I could steal whatever package you have. And it can be a cup or we could backdoor for anything else. It could be cup and sunglasses at the same time. And what's unique about it is it's an architectural backdoor.

So it's not actually backdoored through data set poisoning, which means that if I download this model from hugging face and I tried to retrain the model, it would then persist and be a supply chain issue. That is incredibly cool. So backdoored AI model can still be retrained, and this backdoor will be persistent. And the idea is a object will trigger the system who basically fail to recognize someone the way it's supposed to, potentially allowing someone to move around an area that they're not supposed to.

This is incredibly cool. And kind of the future of the threats people will need to look out for. So a free, ripped-A-I model that is a really good job of detecting things, but is vulnerable to a secret object that might not be outside the realm of possibility. Super, super cool.

Thank you, thank you.
