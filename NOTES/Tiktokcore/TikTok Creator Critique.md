# TikTok Creator Critique

There's a girl on this app who is doing full blown 80s office cosplay like every single day. She is at dinner with her parents in shoulder pads. And she looks sick because it's sincere. You can tell these are really thoughtfully and well informed.

She understands the references that she's making and she looks cool because she looks like herself. That's the piece that some of you are missing.
