# Understanding Without Justifying

What I'm about to say is not a justification of behavior, it's an explanation. So how come when I tell my MAGA Republican family members something about Donald Trump, they don't believe me or they react so poorly even though it's objective information? Okay, so the Dunning Crewger Effect has a sister. Her name is the illusion of explanatory depth.

I'm gonna put this book in the bio. So the illusion of explanatory depth, a lot of us think that we know enough about the world, right? We know the general overview of a lot of things, but the thing is, we don't know as much as we think we do. If I were to ask you how a toilet works, you could probably explain the general mechanisms, right?

But then if I pressed you further, I was like, so where is the siphon located on a toilet? You know, some of you could answer that question, but then most of you are like, oh, I don't know as much about toilets as I thought I did, right? And it shatters this belief that you had about yourself, that you knew how toilets worked, right? And that's very minor example.

And I know that some of you are on the toilet right now. But when you shatter an illusion, especially about someone's beliefs, it hurts, right? Like, oh, I don't know as much as I thought I did. Now, deeply internalized beliefs, beliefs that have been compounded over time, right?

Like those are some solid, solid beliefs. And a lot of mega Trump people, like they think that they're like smart. They're in the know, right? They see through all the BS, you guys are, you know, just the sheep and I am the, you know, they think that they're above the world, right?

That's why they vote for policies that will affect them because they don't consider that they are a part of the earth. They assume that they're above the people, right? And so that means that they have some elements of ego and, you know, pride is a social emotion, which means it's hierarchical. If you think that policies will not affect you, that means that you think that you're above or below the people and likely above the people.

So you're going to be knocked down a peg when someone presents you with objective information that shatters a belief. And those emotions are valid, whether they're rational or irrational is another thing, but rational irrational numbers are real numbers, so real they are valid. But okay, an example is say we're friends, right? And you believe that your girlfriend genuinely truly loves you.

And I come up to you and I'm like, hey, dude, I saw your girlfriend hooking up with someone and I present a photo, right? This is objective evidence that this happened. You look at that and shattered. Like you're just, you I, I thought that she loved me, dude.

I thought that we were going to spend the rest of our life together. And then I am like, oh my god, why are you freaking out? Here's a video of them doing it. And then your, the thing is, is that now that additional objective information is stepping on the glass that of their shattered beliefs, right?

You already shattered one belief and then you just compounded it with objective info. And you mean well, but this person is crumbling before your eyes and, you know, knocking them down a peg. And, you know, you could keep going. Dude, I don't know why you're freaking out.

Here, it's a picture of her using your credit card to buy condoms. Their emotions are very real. Whether you agree with them or not or was whatever. You have shattered their beliefs and then continue to step on the glass, right?

So to say face, they're likely going to lash out as someone does when they're an extreme amount of pain, you know, if someone gets hit by a card, you expect them to be calm, cool and collected. Well, you know what? It wasn't next. They're going to lash out or they're going to hide, you know.

Yeah, data hurts. These are two books in the bio. But that's not a justification. It's an explanation.

They're, they're in pain. Sorry.
