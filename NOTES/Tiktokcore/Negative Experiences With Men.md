# Negative Experiences With Men

It's because they've had negative experiences with men in their life. And due to the way they experienced those experiences, which is what we call trauma, which is essentially memory. The trauma from the easings, the trauma, but do not glorify nor vilify that word. But the trauma, in though from those experiences, causes people already bodily identified, worldly identified, just like the majority of fucking humanity.

This causes them to now fall deeper into protecting themselves, self-preservation, seeing life through a lens of survival. This is why people can't realize or actualize when they are in survival mode. The thing is, most people have those conversations on it from an outside and perspective. Well, this is because of that.

So we fixed this to get that. No, it's actually, it's all the way around. This is independent of that because there is no separation. This is independent of everything else in the sense that this is the only thing that exists.

But the reason you learn that in therapy and through yoga and meditation and psychedelics and all that shit, you only get to that point when, for whatever reason, be it your job or you met a good guy or whatever the fuck worldly reason that you attribute to it, essentially what happens is when you calm down, that's when clarity starts or you become more conscious or you start healing or whatever you want to call it. Like now all your actions are coming from a different level of vision or perception or state of being or whatever, but see in this case, those people are not like that. So now once those human beings start to see by being bodily identified straight through survival mode and first foremost and nothing else, then it's the cause is vision to be skewed. Now they internally identified because rooted in this, man, I'm unsafe.

I'm fucked up. Man, ain't shit. Look at that. Look at that.

Look at that. Look at that. And that ends up causing them to materialize the very things that they don't see, which is now a cycle. You become this way within yourself, a person that can't find a good woman or a good man and I only experience terrible men and terrible women.

Look, I'm telling you, look what happened. Look at this. Look at that. I'm showing you.

It really happened for real. So now you embodied that within yourself mentally, emotionally, you live like that. You essentially start manifesting that. So then you create the bullshit by giving it to yourself.

You see it, materialize. You run into it. That's confirmation. Then you use that to say, I see I was right.

And then you create more bullshit. And then the bullshit shows up and then you respond to that by creating more bullshit. Then it shows up. Then you respond to that.

It's an hour cycle. A the dangerous cycle of limited identity separation, survival mode, whatever you want to call it. Usually people caught up in those self-perpetuating cycles unconsciously. That's how you get that deep rooted anger.

That pain because the people that's living like this, they're not bad people. They just hurt. They hurt. They end pain.

They speaking from a place of pain, a place of it's like a boiling pot of water. It's just a boiling pot of water. It ain't bad. But the only way that shit will actually be cleared for enough of the water to see through itself is if it stops boiling.

And some people stop boiling at different times. You know what I'm saying? I realize this. I'm 28.

I realize this shit at 23. You give them saying? And somebody might not realize this today. 60.

But it's not age has nothing to do with like conscious development has nothing to do with the age of your body. Your soul, your consciousness, the intelligence that you are that all is. Every human is on their own journey in that development. So I might be 28 and you might be 40.

But I might realize some shit at 28 that you might not even realize in his lifetime. Not on some higher, better than or less than type shit. Just know like just as a data point. And all we can do for women or men that's not healed like that is lend the grace that we've given us up.

See I can lend infinite grace in comparison to a lot of people because I have lended myself that kind of grace and have seen myself you know beyond my personality and my body, my and family friends race religion all of that. My identity is my intelligence and everything is that intelligence. So I can't pick a side got a nail me to that motherfucker. I'm sorry because I know that to fix the world or to fix anything in material consequence out here in the world that people are the cause and you just got to you got to get this out there in bulk you hear me but in the meantime that's all you can do.

If all of yourself take those that are willing and pass it on and give the grace that you give as much grace as you give yourself to the people that's you know they they talking shit because they just don't know about they hate me because they just they don't that's just where they're at in that development. Some people got to go to jail to figure some shit out. Some don't. Some got to do some crazy shit and get they self-killed and learn some shit in another learning in another lifetime.

Some don't. Some people got to you know it is what it is and I see it like that and because once you become aware of your ignorance you also then realize you don't know how crazy or how negative or of an impact that may have had up to that point because for every lesson you learned you only learned it because somebody took the shit that came from you living incorrectly in that way. Like you learned how not to burn yourself on the stove by them there burning yourself or burning yourself and somebody had to take that like somebody had to get they stoned fucked up because it cooked for you somebody had to had to tend to your womb so somebody even if it's even if it's the yolk your dog somebody had to deal with you life physicality you existed in the physical world and whatever fucked up state you was in and you got to exist in it. While you was being a bitch or while you was growing or while you was mad at the world because you was grieving or while you didn't feel good that up until the point you realized your ignorance to that to a certain degree you realized that the entire world had to put up with you and you been allowed to just exist in this motherfuckin like not saying whether you in jail or not the fact that you are still allowed to exist your existence is not automatically deleted due to the actions done in your ignorance that fucking factor right there helps me realize that oh okay I got a lot of grace to give motherfuckers because a lot has been given to me by people by my house by the my socks like when you ain't wipe your ass your your drawers was dirty and they dealt with it you get what I'm saying you broke your cats is that you can't steal a little you like all of this shit like the grace you're giving on a daily basis is infinite so how could I not but that's all we can do realize I see us inspire those willing and give grace to those that just ain't there yet but yeah that's why women hate me and you know they just this is just how they've come to see the life at this point as their vision evolves what they see will evolve and when what they the more what they see evolves the more the material life around them evolves because this is how this shit goes and for all of us on this planet as individuals and as a collective
