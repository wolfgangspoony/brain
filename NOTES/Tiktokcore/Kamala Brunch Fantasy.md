# Kamala Brunch Fantasy

If Kamala was president, we'd all be at brunch. If Kamala was president, we'd all be at brunch. If Kamala was president, we'd be at brunch. If Kamala won, we'd be at brunch.

Okay, now we make sense. Because while Biden and Harris was the team in office, and they spent $1.2 trillion for anti-immigration, y'all was at brunch. And when Biden spent $95 billion on Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, y'all was at brunch. Okay, so we are really pissed off about is that y'all can't go to brunch?

That's why y'all in the streets, I can't dance fool, I can like y'all care about immigration issues. So let me get this straight. If Kamala Harris got to be president, and y'all could go to brunch, then y'all wouldn't be outside protesting. Of course not, because y'all could still be able to take advantage of undocumented workers.

Paying them kittens and getting them to pick grapes and strawberries. Right, because that was the argument that I was hearing before this happened. Oh, now y'all prices are y'all gross, so you're gonna go up, cause who's gonna pick the vegetables? Who's gonna pick the fruits?

That's all y'all really cared about when it came to these undocumented workers, right?
