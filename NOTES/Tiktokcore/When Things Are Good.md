# When Things Are Good

Bro, I just figured out what changed about the TikTok algorithm and why all the big creators is on this big saying damn my backup account They all own backup accounts my backup account doing better than my main account with millions and hundreds of thousands of followers And a lot of the new people who just started posting on take-out who just started making content is like damn this shit This shit jumping. Why shit doing good because I know we all been seeing more people talk about how good their content is doing And the small creators and we see it all these smaller creators do better. I figured out what the fuck happened I got them bitches. So basically follow me.

It's gonna be kind of choppy I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but before TikTok went dog Basically, they made a deal with fucking America and the government in some sense because America Tiktok like we need to operate in America. We want to we really want to and America like we need some censorship So we got to do something they basically came to this understanding and it looked like this Every account on TikTok that was made before TikTok went dog and all content posted Before TikTok went dog and had been disappeared for that time was all put under this fucking this type of micro So like we can't go through it and sense all that shit because it's too much shit from the day Tiktok went dog on back to the time we all got on it too much content to sift through we can't do that So we're gonna just suppress or do something we're gonna affect that content in some way And we're gonna affect all accounts that were created prior to TikTok going dog in some way We're gonna affect them all in some way and we're gonna affect the future content from every account that was created prior to TikTok going dog Or whatever now as for the content that's coming from accounts that were created after TikTok with dog And as well as new accounts that are created now We're gonna let those accounts operate freely under no suspicion and they're gonna have a what we would call it Creators a fair shot. That's why anybody that's been posting content from their account that was existing before TikTok went dog is like what the fuck but then when you get on a fresh account Oh damn man ain't seeing you if ever. Oh man you back on my FYP.

Oh man my content jumping again Damn I got millions over here but my backup account booming damn I just made my TikTok today and I've been on here for 30 days and my ship in jumping That's what the fuck it is they not suppressing certain people they just going off of a time frame This account is damn near at two thousand followers or whatever and I just started posting on this bitch today And my comments is full of people saying Brian's seeing you in years where you been you've been on my FW you back on my FYP Despite I have an account that I didn't had since like 2021 or 2022 that's at 1.6 million and it still get good views But you can tell that the content. I don't know where it's going But it's it's going in a it's going in a circle of some shit if you give what I'm saying So that's what it is TikTok basically reset itself on the day that it went dark And the best thing you could have done on that day was make a new account and keep keep going in don't get rid of your old account Because you can still use it but to keep it fresh make a new and god damn oh But that's crazy and this is why all the new creators are experiencing a boom and all the old creators are experiencing a boom on their new accounts You bitches oh they play with us god damn it fucking play with us that shit They trying to get y'all minds they trying to get y'all man I figured it out. I knew it. I'm not wrong.

Am I wrong am I chirping?
