# The Job Market is Broken

And another thing because this gets me heated, unless you've been on a job search in the last two years you do not know how bad it is out here. The job market is trash, it's been bad. I'm talking about applying the 20 jobs today, reaching out to recruiters, doing this only thing, and hearing crickets. People are trying, people are not lazy.

And then people who have a job give the most useless advice, like why don't you tailor your resume to every single job? You don't think that I've done that? Unless your job is hiring and you have a referral, zip it.
