# Second American Revolution - A Manifesto

Dude, this is total confirmation because I totally woke up this morning. So, check this out. Hey guys, this is the start of the second American Revolution. My name's Gabe DeGrey.

What's up? Bro, this is confirmation. I'm starting the revolution today. I woke up this morning because I've been posting like three, five times a day trying not to get banned on TikTok.

But I woke up this morning. I was like, you know what? Fuck it, bro. Our lives, bro, are at stake.

Everything we work for, everything that means something to us. Our children's lives are at stake. And I'm not waiting on no, no, but like that's the thing. This, hit here.

Okay. Here's what we're going to do. Okay. Here's how we're going to get our country back.

Understand something. Okay. Donald Trump is a bitch. Okay.

And I say that with botanism, I say that with conviction, when without fear of power because it's the truth. The issue that we have right now is people just aren't saying the truth. Okay. Donald, when I say Donald Trump is a bitch, what I mean is that he needs people around him who are going to constantly, constantly appease him, constantly tell him what his ears wants to hear.

So how do you beat that? Everybody everywhere, all at once saying the truth. Hick liars cannot exist around the truth. The issue is not that people lie.

The issue is not that people, um, that there are manipulators and abusers. The issue is that we don't stand up and you and everybody's waiting for somebody else to stand up for him. I'm not waiting. I'm the guy.

Okay. Here's what we're going to do. The reason why I post it on my content in like three, four minute sound bites because we are going to overwhelm the market. We're going to overwhelm TikTok.

I want you guys to take these, put them on Instagram, create accounts and do it. The goal is is you have to save the truth relentlessly. And again, I'm not telling you something that I don't know. I literally lost custody of my children for telling the truth.

Click the link in my bio. I'm not joking about this stuff and I've not stopped telling the truth. This is why I agree with you and I see it now. I do believe I'm the man for the job because the only thing we need right now is someone who's going to lead us in truth telling liars cannot exist with the truth.

You don't go back and forth about facts with motherfuckers. You don't go back and forth with like I had a guy. That's what I wanted to debate climate change. Nigger cut a tree down.

The fuck are you talking about? Of course we affect the climate. It's like stop debating with people. When people are liars, when people are bad faith factors, when people are saying things that are going to destroy the reality of your children, like my children won't have a future if we do not stand up and just relentlessly say the truth.

So when I'm telling you guys, the second American revolution has started and what we have is what they didn't have in the past. This is why protesting on Donald Trump's birthday is stupid. Don't protest on this birthday. Everybody, all at once, say the truth on his birthday.

No, go to his parade and boo him. No, no, no, you don't, you don't, you don't go from afar. Stop using 1960s methods in 2025. Pick up your phone and say the truth.

They can't take us all off social media because they make money off of us. Are they going to run ads? Have you guys thought about that? How are they going to run ads if they demonetize everybody's video?

How are they going to run ads if they censor all of us? The issue is not that they're going to censor us. The issue is we have not made them censor all of us. Okay?

So use my videos. You don't want to set yourself if something resonates with you with my videos. Use these videos today. I'm going to try to finish this manifesto.

What I need from you guys, make sure you're watching my videos all the way through. Make sure you're commenting, make sure you're sharing, make sure you're reposting. We are going to save this country. Okay?

The first thing we need to do, the number before we raise money, before we do any of that, because we're going to have to raise money. This is what it is. But before we do all that, say the truth. Say the truth.

Just say it, say it, say it, say it. Repost this. Clip it up. Plit.

I love you. Please. For you. If you want to keep doing this, share this.

Share this. Share this. I'm about to go hard to we're about to turn up I'm about to get into the Constitution. I'm about to get into the legislative branch.

And we are going to show these people. All you need is the truth. I have the truth. A phone and a priest and I'm about to change the world.

Okay. That's all you need. Okay. Here we go guys.

We about to save our country this week. Fuck that nigga. not gonna see us coming. This is why we ought to go hard, we gotta go fast.

This is the issue of conviction. I'm not about to sit here and convince people who I am. Go research me, go check who I am. I'm trying to save my country.

I'm trying to save my daughters. Whatever, y'all, I'm not here to debate right or left. What I know is that the lie of the United States of America is crumbling and we gotta do something about it. So share my stuff, watch my stuff all the way through, leave comments.

After I've complete the manifesto, got about 50 more. I'm gonna start replying to comments. And then, and then guys, once I get like 10,000 followers, then that's when we're gonna give them the plan. I'm gonna give you guys the knockout blow, okay?

Trust me, this is what I do. Go look me up, gave the grade, gave real read, gave read. We're over on Facebook taking down a coat right now, two days, right? We got the feds involved, we got the police involved, we got the law involved.

Like, we know how to take down coats over here. And America, the lie, the lie that is the American experiment, is crumbling. It's been one big 250 year coat, okay? This mind control of what America is and all that scrumbling, okay?

I got you guys though, I've been through this, all right? Here we go. Second American Revolution, start today, let's go.
