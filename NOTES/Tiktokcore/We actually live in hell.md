# We Actually Live in Hell

We actually live in hell. Parking spots earn more per hour than human beings. Money just turns into more money by being a number on the right computer. Charging people for being poor generates billions of dollars a year.

So when you ask me a dumbass question, like where's the money gonna come from? I'm gonna look at you like you just sat on a cactus because the answer is simply get rid of money or just change the number in everyone's bank account because babe, we made the economy up. It's as real as astrology. You know what's not made up?

The fact that human beings do even have a chance to survive will need food, clean water, and shelter. Oh!
