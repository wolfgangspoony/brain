# Making People Uncomfortable

You say things that make people uncomfortable. That must mean you lack social awareness. No, I'm aware. I know that speaking my mind, my earful, some feathers.

I just don't care. I don't lack social awareness. I lack social compliance. But hey, if you want to write me off as an awkward oblivious dummy, feel free to do so.

Perceived ignorance is also bliss.
