# Eloquent Video Incoming

This is about to be the most eloquent video of my entire life. I typed out my thoughts so that I don't get lost in the sauce. I began watching the H3 podcast when I was in college and during the pandemic. I would say 2018 to 2020 ish.

They were one of, if not the first podcast I started to regularly watch. My little sister put me on and I enjoyed having Ethan and Ela in crew in the, as background conversation throughout my days. I watched the rise and follow frenemies and was saddened by the way everything went down. My sister also told me about their leftovers podcast.

I was not interested in listening to two men talk politics for hours at a time. As years went on, I started listening to different podcasts, a little bit of comedy, a little bit of history. I enjoyed keeping up with the H3 happenings and Teddy fresh releases on social media but I didn't listen to the podcast every day like I had during the pandemic. As someone who is very passionate about history, I feel ashamed at the reality that I didn't know anything about the Israel Palestine conflict until after October 7, 2023.

If you would have asked me on October 6th, if I have been propagandized towards Israel, I would have said no. As I sit here in May of 2025, I can confidently tell you, yes I had been. Not by Ethan and Ela, but by the fact that I was one course credit away from having a minor degree in Middle Eastern studies and the history of Israel was never discussed. The word Palestine was not said.

My father is who I get my love for history from. I remember asking him throughout my life and in college, what's the deal with Israel? Why does everyone around them have a problem? What's the deal?

And he told me the conflict goes all the way back to the Bible. I know now that he's incorrect. In fact, he's called me in recent months. Saying the same, I feel embarrassed I didn't know anything.

At 28, I understand I am very biased towards my father. My father could still kick your dad's eyes. But the fact that he didn't know made me realize Israel is or was America's best kept secret. On February 1, 2024, I was fired from my job in higher education for challenging the institution's inability to prove gainful employment.

Since this time, I have been fortunate enough to make my living off of my content. You have you guys. I got a library card that week. And I checked out every book that my local library had to offer on Palestine.

The first two books I read were The Blockade on the Gaza Strip, published by opposing viewpoints. And Gaza by Norm Finkelstein. Besides my own lived experiences, learning about the Palestinian struggle has been the singular most politically radicalizing experience of my life. I was 5 when 9-11 happened.

I don't remember the fear or stress of that day. But for the past year and a half, I have watched the Gaza people live stream the most disturbing assault on humanity I have ever seen in my life. I have watched children learn English in order to beg for their life. I have watched people wish for death.

I have pondered the significance of a Ramadan fast to people who are starving. As a child, I couldn't use the house phone at the same time my sister was playing games on a desktop. In a matter of 20 years, I'm typing this on my laptop with an iPhone in my pocket. The internet has changed the world insanely fast.

Ironically, today, May 4th is the anniversary of the Kent State massacre, when the National Guard murdered four students for protesting the Vietnam War. These students had perhaps seen snippets on TV, heard whispers of the Meal I massacre, or lost men in their life to the draft. It was a gradual realization of the wrongness of American imperialism. Since October 7th, 2023, the brutality of Israeli forces unto Palestinian people has been absolutely glaring.

It has not been a gradual realization. The mask has been ripped entirely off. My allegation may seem dramatic, but as a student of history, I truly believe that TikTok has damn near single-handedly foiled the Zionist project. That's extreme.

But... TikTok, as a non-American entity, was not programmed to push a certain narrative or a certain side of the story. This is a seismic shift. The young people of this country have seen far too much.

I believe that the exposure of Israel's genocide elections have caused a rise in anti-Semitism. This is a direct result of Israel's intentional conflation of Zionism and Judaism. In fact, a rise of anti-Semitism outside of Israel further solidifies the Zionist argument that Israel must exist since the Jewish populist will always be targeted. What I'm saying is, the first videos I ever saw regarding Israel were from the H3 channel years before October 7th even happened, years before I knew anything.

The second videos I have seen regarding Israel were of lifeless bodies in Gaza. Ethan has said recently that there is a rising radicalization in Israel because Israelis feel the tide turning in global opinion. The voice that is missing from this rapid-on-masking is the voice of the child in Tel Aviv, the child who did not choose to be born in Israel. That child is not a threat to Palestinian freedom.

There is essentially no voice regarding Israelis who recognize the slaughter committed by their leaders. This void could have been filled by Ethan and Elykline. When a school shooting happens, there is always someone saying, don't give them an inch regarding one's individual right to Onagon. If we implement a mandatory weight period, that will be a slippery slope to abolishing the right of every American to Onagon ever.

They're going to come and round up your guns. This is paranoid thinking and it is simply not real. There must be a gun owner willing to say America has a problem with gun control. There must be a cop willing to say, that's a officer who abused their power.

There must be an Israeli saying, Palestinians must live freely. This does not mean you're burning all your guns. This does not mean you are betraying the fraternity of policemen. This does not mean you are turning your back on Ela's family.

It means you are centering the people who are actively suffering. Thank you.
