# Before Money - Barter Myth Debunked

A lot of people think that before money we actually traded or bartered for everything, but believe it or not, most anthropologists think that's a myth. And it's kind of a harmful myth that props up capitalism. I want to talk about it. If you're unfamiliar, the myth of bartering is that in early human societies, people would trade, say, their goats for grain, which was inefficient, so they invented money to make this trading easier, and then later that credit and debit systems that look like traditional money evolved.

What my guy, David Graber, and many anthropologists argue is that this narrative is backwards. There is, in fact, almost no evidence of societies relying primarily on barter. What actually came first out of sharing economies was credit and debt, embedded in social relationships, not just impersonal transactions. What Graber says and other anthropologists is that first, barter among strangers is really rare in history.

The idea comes from economists, not anthropologists. Real barter tends to happen under very specific conditions, like between strangers, during a crisis, or across groups that don't trust each other, so they need to have some kind of transaction relationship. Most early human societies were gift-based and obligation-based, like relational. Most pre-monetary economies operated on reciprocity, social cohesion, like we lived together, so we should learn to work together.

People gave freely, knowing that the social norm was to return favors over time. Some people called this generalized reciprocity. It wasn't just tip-for-tat, you gave me this, so I owe you that. The third thing is that money often has emerged from systems of credit, not trade.

In many cases, the earliest forms of money work records of debt, you know, think like those clay tablets from Mesopotamia, not coins used to buy things. Coinage usually came later, often for paying soldiers or taxes if you lived in a nation state. The barter myth mostly persists for ideological reasons. It fits neatly into capitalist ideology, that humans are naturally self-interested traders and markets arise naturally, but anthropological fieldwork shows that really we evolved from something much more relational and relaxed.

So that's the actual consensus. Among economic anthropologists, scholars of early societies, there is broad agreement. That one barter was never a dominant form of exchange in cohesive communities to that sharing, gifting, informal credit systems were the backbone of economies we have today, and that the barter to money to credit timeline is a myth popularized mostly by Adam Smith and economists, not based on field research or archaeology. If this is interesting to you, I recommend first David Graber's book, Debt, the first 5,000 years, it's a really good history of money, well sourced and cited.

And then I also recommend you search for a creator called Bobcat. This is her right here. She's got a fantastic video about the myth of barter that says everything I said here, but a little more orderly and eloquently, and Bobcat, if you're watching, we need your voice. I hope to see you posting again soon.

Leave your questions in the comments and let's keep talking about it. Money, we can do better.
