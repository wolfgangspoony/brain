# 12-Year-Old Explains Why Adulthood is a Net Loss

So then what do you think about being an adult? I would never want to be an adult. It sounds horrible I just raised some houses that went up from 3% to 7% Wait, how do you know that? I don't know A pair of apartment prices across America Financially moving to Thailand makes more sense Thailand?

Yes, but to go to Thailand I need my passport and I have to have it for at least six months You have what what are you watching online? How do you know office? I don't know Those complain about stress all the time Not only as the GDP far less are going up, but wait just stay in the States That's crazy because when I was 12, I couldn't wait to be an adult I wanted my own house. I wanted to be able to travel home and this client is a Vincuise by $5,000 on average in California, Lonesome's Copies You know those always look stressed out and mad So why would I want to become like that?

I'm not going to lie, these people do be looking stressed out So I can't blame you, but like you don't got like something cool You want to do as an adult that you can't do now You want to play games all day and I can do that now without having to pay bills It's a phone bill electric bill gas bill car bill you have all these bills I'm like that's him You right? You right? You right? I do pay bills Being an adult is a net loss, well all I have now is net games If all adults have they wish they want to be kids Oh you're going to be an adult You low-key kind of smarter than me Rather than worry about the future, it's more important to enjoy the present because of the alleviate stress Where did you get so intelligent?

What happened? I don't know Where? I only know the majority of the stuff I know because of social media I don't know if everything bad I see online is from adults I don't want to be when I was like 12 Social media was a bunch of memes You wasn't learning nothing, it was just memes all the time People was laughing, nobody was fighting Social media was actually funny at one time Maybe ending because Bayonet has decided to manipulate the masses Stract them from a class war People have less energy to address the honey you're going to be a Harvard graduate Most people pay for the kids to get in the heart Their legacy students I just save my money and go to a trade school You know about trade school The schools are like the poor man's Harvard unless your parents are rich or went through already And if I'm going to work I'd rather make a lot of money and buy more video games Okay well it seems like you have your life together more than I have mine So good talking to you You was well brother I was the only one who joined the military because of the oil industrial complex I don't want to be an influencer because I no longer have privacy NO! What are you?
