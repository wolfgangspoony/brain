# Cat Experience Story

I was looking to Mark Merrin talk about cats on the really good pod path with Bobby Alta and he's a cat owner and he clearly likes cats. But he was saying the usual things that a lot of cat owners say which is that you know cats don't really necessarily like us when I'm really sure that there's around for anything other than food and things like that. I had never had that experience with cats and I think probably the reason is that I had a cat what I was very very young. I mean I was a baby up until maybe age four so and he's still my favorite pet in my memory.

I think I kind of absorbed the cat mindset or something and I'm always coming up to cats and then they will come and know them and friend them and often think that their cat never likes strangers but I think that's the kind of thing that they like. They like strangers but they like me they'll let me pet their cat even when no other human is able to do except for them. I had a cat once that was so attached to me and my wife that when we left the apartment our house made told us that he would just sit there and wail like a like a crying child. He would be sitting at the door waiting for us to come home somehow he sensed when we were coming home.

When we called him he would come running you know like he was so affectionate. I personally think a lot of this has to do with you you have to understand the mentality of cats I mean they they can be extremely affectionate but. You have to move to them that you understand their point of view in a way example a lot of people say well they can you know cats are very skittish they don't want to be petted but you know I see when they like reaching and like try to pet a cat like you can't do that like you have to stop you have to give them space you have to let them come to you. So basically I think cats don't like most humans even people who like cats they don't really become bonded with them in the same way that dogs tend to do.

I my personal feeling is it's because the owners don't show the cat that they are thinking about the way the cat thinks they're kind of you have to enter into their psychology and respond to them in a way that they recognize. I think maybe I picked us up from having that cat when I was really really young the reality is they want affection just like dog just like any other pets but if you aren't paying attention to the way they see the world then they're just going to think well you don't care about me so why should I care about you. I think that's not so much that they think you don't care about them I think it's more that they they know that you don't really understand the way they think that's my theory.
