# How to Protest Effectively

There's a right and a wrong way to protest. Starting riots is not the answer. Okay, well, can we burn the flag? No, you can't disrespect the flag.

Okay, well, can we wave another flag? No, you can't wave another flag. Okay, well, just what if we take a knee during the national anthem? No, you can't do that either.

Okay, well, what if we just stand in the street and block traffic and stop the system from moving forward? No, people gotta get the work. You can stand against the system, but you can't stop it from moving. Okay, well, what if we blocked the government workers from doing what they're doing without hurting them?

No, you can't do that. They got jobs to do and you gotta let them do it. Well, goddamn, what's the right way to protest then? I'm glad you asked.

The right way to protest is to say, no, no, no, we don't want this to happen loud as you can, but just stay out the way while you do it. So you want me to stand against something without hindering it in any way until the people I'm standing against just stop because they hear me saying stop. Yeah, if you say stop loud enough, eventually they'll stop. And no matter how much they ignore you, you can't give violent.

Okay, so is there any other options? Yup, the best way to protest is to not protest. And then you won't have to deal with none of that. Pfft!
