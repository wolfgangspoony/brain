# That Actually Happened

So I don't know if you guys remember a few months ago when the Trump administration said that they would be administering loyalty tests to new FBI agents, new CIA agents, etc. So on and so forth. Well that actually happened. Yeah, they did that.

The soldiers that were standing behind him and that thing of a Bob with their little berets. They were all screened for their political views and their loyalty to Donald Trump, which is why it's so scary when you see them laughing because basically they're all sociopathic. Donald Trump wanted to administer loyalty test to federal employees back in his last term, but he wasn't able to do it. In this term, he has successfully been able to screen federal employees and apparently also military for their loyalty to his administration specifically.

So seeing senators getting arrested is not shocking whatsoever because the chances that the arresting officer, the arresting FBI agent in question, was administered a loyalty test is pretty high. This is not a new thing throughout history whatsoever. Hitler, Stalin, Putin, administered loyalty tests to see who would have their back. It's a form of paranoia, right?

Because as a dictator, you don't want to get killed by someone from the inside and you don't want your authority questioned from the inside because you are most vulnerable as a dictator around your inner circle. So you have to make sure that everyone in your inner circle aligns with you specifically, which is why Stalin killed so many people in his inner circle. It's going to get worse and more government officials will be arrested under this regime because we are in a dictatorship and the people doing the arresting were administered loyalty tests to Donald Trump. And that is how you know that the ship is sunk.
