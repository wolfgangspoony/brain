# Mass Protests Documentation

I'm here at Philadelphia, a birthplace of freedom. You can see literally thousands, thousands of people marching down Ben Franklin Parkway. As I told you earlier, we're not standing for it. We don't want to see masked men stealing people off the fucking street.

We want due process. We want the rights that we are promised right here at Philadelphia. The rights we are promised in our fucking Constitution are rights that were promised in the fucking Declaration of Independence. These colors don't run.

They're stars for everybody. Make your voice heard. No kings. Go birds, fuck truck.

Go birds, fuck truck. Go birds, fuck truck. Go birds, fuck truck. They heard me yelling and they offered me air.

But like, they're like, they're trying to protect people's ears from me. And from everybody else, let them air it.
