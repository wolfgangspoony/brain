# You guys see this

You guys see this. So somebody posted this video of this cat wagonist tale along to the beat. That's adorable. I love it so much.

But in the comments, someone said that they had a cat many years ago who used to do that and they started keeping track of the songs they liked and then they made a mixtape. Melodies for Pancho from August 1998, 1988 and I was like I need to put this together in a Spotify playlist but someone, of course, already did that. And here it is. Melodies for Pancho in 1988.

This is the most beautiful thing ever. Like first off, it's a really good mixtape. There's a lot of really good bands on here. The last track is a squeeze track.

This cat had a macular taste. But also like 1988 was the year I was born. So all of these songs must have been very popular back then because I know all of them. And this is like a mixtape that I would have put together.

It's crazy. But anyway, go rap Pancho.
