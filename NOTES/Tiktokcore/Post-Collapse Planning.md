# Post-Collapse Planning

So people have started talking about what we'd look like in the fourth dimension. And I wanted to mention Slutterhouse5 because Kurt Vonnegut writes about the Traffin adorns, how they view time differently, how they see the fourth dimension, how they perceive time all is happening at once. So when they look at humans, what they see is us is worms, with baby feet at one end and then at the end, the elderly version of us. So in that idea, imagine what it's like when we connect physically, when we connect in similar spaces, what is happening to our bodies when we're taking up space in similar areas?

We're intertwining, we're like these mosaics, basically, as well as I'm imagining, these worms, these millipedes, these, I'm so I swear I says the word millipede in there, I haven't read it in a while. And so what's happening is just we're worms intertwining and having these insane, probably patterns, because to imagine how we exist like as humans, right, we've created systems for us to go down and through. So it's like, I'm going to have a son and he's going to learn what I know. And then he'll teach his son that son that son that son that's an honor, honor one.

So we are creating new, but even then, right, imagine what it's like to give birth and where we're coming from. It is this infinite snake millipede again, like it's just so it's so crazy intertwining in itself, right, it kind of becomes a snake eating itself in a way. I'm just getting off the dome random of dots and outs, so yeah, but I would love to discuss this more.
