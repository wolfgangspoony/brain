# Hair Transplant Tourism Satire

In a world where everyone is balding, going to Turkey and getting a hair transplant, there are trailblazers out there who are breaking the rules and doing things far beyond our comprehension. Let me introduce to you guys the eclipse fade. The eclipse fade is a last resort haircut for those who refuse to bend the knee to a hair transplant, monoxidil or a dermal ruler. They look baldness, deadly eyes, embrace it and tell it, I am going nowhere.

No, I'm here to stay. And a matter of fact, I'm going to look damn good doing it too. I like to look at the eclipse fade as an extreme sense of confidence because not everyone can cool us off. And certainly not anybody is just going to do this to their head unless they are bald.

And so to just not let go of the hair and be this innovative has me shook. I mean, look at this guy. Clearly, a perfect candidate for a hair transplant. And he says, no, I'm not bending the knee.

And it looks swaggy. I mean, tell me he puts on a fire fit and that's not going to just enhance his game. Riz, if you will. Look at this guy.

Older gentleman, going bald, perfect candidate. And instead of doing the two pays and everything, look at this fade. Look at the design. Hands clapping for the barber.

And of course, we have this last gentleman here. With the blow out fade eclipse fade, absolutely crazy. Let's just give it up to the barbers who bring people back to life of resurrection, if you will. Right?

Because this is crazy here. It looks wild, but it's better than what he had before. But if the eclipse fade is not for you, you've tried the derma rollers and you've tried the oils of the knocks of the, you think you're ready for a hair transplant. Download the hair back app, go to my website, the pierc group ink dot net, and use my code.

It's right down there on the bottom and talk to some people who have undergoing a hair transplant or a beer transplant. And if you want to get set up with a consultation, just shoot me a DM and tag somebody with a cooked hair line and let them know that they're still home.
