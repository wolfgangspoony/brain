# Bimboism and Nervous System Regulation

If you have a dysregulated nervous system, bimboism might be for you. Bimboism is just a pretty girl version of the law of assumption and the law of assumption will also help your nervous system. When you assume good things come to you, you feel better about yourself. You take more offers.

Gen Z came along a few years ago and started reclaiming the term. This was an immediate rejection from the traditional take everything serious where the man's pants type of movement. So a bimbo does not ask to be seen as worthy. They do not ask for respect.

They assume that it will come to them. An example of this is assuming that you will get the dream job that you want simply because you exist. Basically, you know your worth and because of that more things will come to you. It's basically a living assumption.

It is perfectly fine for you to assume that your work will pay off.
