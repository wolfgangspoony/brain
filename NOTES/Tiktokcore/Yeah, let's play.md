# Yeah, let's play

Hey little man. She's a girl. Oh, for God. How you been?

Yeah, let's play. Yeah, give me one minute. Yeah, I'm trying to get my visit back. Hold on, dog.

Come out here with her mom and fuck this sometimes. That's really good. Uh, she fell. Oh, my bad.

Where's your mom? Trying to get back together? I married. Soccer's got a goalie.

How old is she now, like two? She's five. Five. That's cool.

Hey, I'm going to need you to cut me some slack on that $50 child support payment. I got to, I'm trying to launch my construction business right now. It's about to be huge. I just can't afford the $50 right now.

Three weeks. I mean, I could pay you $100 a month. Listen, baby. Dude, that's not fun.

It's my left child. This is one carrot goal. I'm not supposed to wear them now. You, you're the crazy one.

You always been abusive. Get that girl's number over there. That's going to be your new mommy. Go get it.

I don't want to be your ex. I'm trying to be your oh. Hey, can I get a bush light?
