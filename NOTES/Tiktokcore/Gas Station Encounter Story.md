# Gas Station Encounter Story

So I'm at the gas station. I go inside to pay and this black guy walks up to me. He goes you know you one of us now And I laughed I said I know and he's like yeah, that's all I've been watching on TikTok. I said absolutely So I'm paying and there's a lot of people in the store mostly black people and the guy's leaving and he says all right See you later black people and he looks at me and he winks and I got to say this has been an amazing turn of events
