# US Ambassador to Denmark Satire

Hello, I'm the US ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howrie. President Trump will annex Greenland for national security one way or another and will tear off anyone who gets in our way. Hello, I'm the White House Press Corps. The US has had bases there for 80 years and they've already said that you could build more.

So why do you actually want Greenland? Trump, Megadonor Peter Teal wants to build unregulated freedom cities there, just like Prospera in Honduras. And we can make our own laws and freely run social experiments, trade crypto, and even strip my Greenland's rare earth minerals. To build it, billionaires have poured over $500 million into praxis, a freedom city start up founded by Dryden Brown.

His hobbies include collecting fascist literature and phonology, which is the racist myth that bumps on your skull predictor intelligence. Pro what the fuck?
