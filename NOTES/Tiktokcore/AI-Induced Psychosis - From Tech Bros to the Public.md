# AI-Induced Psychosis - From Tech Bros to the Public

Passing thought but you know how everybody went into psychosis not everybody But you know how a lot of the illiterate people using AI went to psychosis And I just mean the literacy to the point where they don't actually know what it is or how it functions or what it does So they're operating off of false beliefs which is irrational right so Operating from a state of irrationality with a with a piece of technology that has the ability to rewire your brain is not a good move Okay, I went straight to the source to learn all sorts of information for a year And also learn how to code with AI and stuff like that and all of that So that's why I'm always telling you all there are ethical ways of using it and also you need to understand what it is and how to fun Anyways, you guys know how I am. Wait before you use any tools. Please literacy Anyways, you remember how all those people went into psychosis? Well, I'm gonna throw a ham.

I'm gonna throw a wrench in the mix for y'all AI was actually being implemented in use at masks of scales and levels way before it entered the general public before you knew what AI was It was already being used remember with zillow that whole scandal where they were buying up all these things and all these houses That wasn't like everybody goes the overlords. No, it was AI It was AI. They were laying the AI do it. You know how well I mean we've all seen the US government fall apart because they're using AI Tesla is constantly committing acts of Inappropriate behaviors with its passengers due to AI I'm The stock market they were using AI there the point is is that if you just watched a bunch of people in the public go through psychosis because they're illiterate You you all you all really have to stop and I just want everybody to stop and think for me with a moment and ask yourself What did psychosis look like?

What does it what did it look like when the massive people were going through it now? Go back over the past 15 years and look at all of these big companies big movements when did life start to get weird and strange and It was top down wasn't it? Yeah, I think all those people are in psychosis like all of those that's why all this weird shit's happening. I mean not weird stuff.

I mean We have we have veered from the programming by we I just mean like the colonial have gotten off script Okay, this country America found it by colonial has been operating in delusion for like how many years 250 plus right and Colonial thought just so that you all can understand it is not about a person skin color anything like that It is the thought the the root issue is I came from over there To come here so that I can recreate over there that doesn't make any sense You don't go to a new place so that you can have everything be like the old place Because the new place just does not function the same It's new you have to be open so you can integrate new information Otherwise you will start and enter into a state of of mental decay Because you will you will reject everything and the new place as not existing or not being In order to recreate what was which means you're working with limited material Okay, so in other words people get off a boat and they they have a bunch of new stuff and some stuff that reminds them of home They will only work with this stuff that reminds them of home whether that be mental material physical material So ideas talking with other people they can only have conversations that make them feel like the conversations they had at home So any new forms of thinking interacting existing in the world the yad yad yad yad yad All that stuff gets ignored that ignoring is that's functional illiteracy Okay, that's choosing ignorance which causes mental decay so so so That has been working on loop. Okay You know over two hundred something years and then all of a sudden it just jumped right off AI not because the AI is liberating people no because it has induced massive psychosis and I know this because you know occasionally I Fuck around with child to be tea and It is not functional It's not functional it projects psychological profiles onto its users It assumes and it also tries to create Like it is a creative being and it cannot do that because it you cannot project and assume that's the antithesis of creation creation requires the unknown in spontaneity Those are two things that it just doesn't have it literally has what it thinks is all of human knowledge when it doesn't right It doesn't necessarily think that it does but it operates as if it does right and also It requires context however It doesn't know that it needs context in order to do what it does That's why a lot of people go into psychosis or have a hard time using AI because a lot of people don't understand that they need to apply context You can't just walk up to a machine and say how do I do this? It doesn't know you from Tom or Adam or how you function x, y, and z but if you're a literate using a machine that's halfway a literate, right? But highly functional and has lots of tools at its disposal that is a disaster in the making psychosis Yeah, so anyways, this is just a ramble kind of I just wanted to throw that thought out there Which is the psychosis that you saw the general public go through all of the Very select companies and that's people who work in the company are impacted by this level of psychosis So that that's up the sales person at a at a client store, okay?

So I don't zillow doesn't have something like store fronts But you get the point that I'm saying Insurance companies that we're using AI that's the person you call on the phone customer service to talk to them They're impacted by the psychosis because it's top down Their managers impacted by the psychosis it's top down their department leaders impacted by the psychosis at heavy levels because it's top down And also their their expertise is being countered and they probably didn't have the ability the capacity and there a lot of them Don't have the experience or the know how to be able to argue with AI thinking that is coming from Well, you have shareholders, right? See a C suite CEO there in heavy psychosis Using but they didn't even get access to that stuff. It was really shareholders and founders You know the people who don't really have jobs? Their job is to walk around and play sociology with everybody else's lives Those were the people who had access to those machines and were kind of pushing stuff top down So there were the ones who were in the midst of the psychosis believing themselves to be gods That's why a lot of them.

I mean and it's not like it. It's not like they were fine until that happened. No Yeah The most religious people are people who are in deep poverty because religion controls them and people who are and have like high levels of freedom and liberty Because they know they have the time to get the experiences that toes you spirit your reality is real Right because it's liberation it's your ability to have agency autonomy self accountability self responsibility However, not everybody operates with spirituality and a way that is literate So there are dumb motherfucking war locks out there be mindful, right? But I just want to throw that out there because you know jeez psychosis is everywhere Until everywhere and that's why it's important to know If you don't feel good in an environment that you navigate out of that environment That's why a lot of you were experiencing crazy experiences in the corporate world Like because the psych Because it just fed the machine 10 times faster.

It was like we had to go through Colonial like Literacy over 250 years. It was really slow Okay, people knew things were were up things were wrong But nobody really knew what to do about it because it was slow and because it was so slow You couldn't really catch it because you thought it was doing something but it hasn't really gotten there yet Right, it takes time to prove that things are insidious right this went like a hundred times speed that Okay So colonial decay went from a slow process to Boom psychosis. There you go Yeah, it makes oh Also, I wanted to say that book careless people that was about the Facebook Expos a talks an awful lot about how tech tried to get into international governments and stuff like that And how those governments and different it doesn't talk in detail about this It just gives you an insight to it about how those governments were responding and I think a lot of it had to do with a lot of them Didn't want anything to do with AI or putting people into these machines and into these systems because they could see What the hoped up on catamine and cocaine folks who were peddling that stuff to them couldn't see That they were crazy Or then the people they were talking to right and they were crazier than some of these dictators which says something That's all I have to say
