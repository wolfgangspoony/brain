# Breaking Free From Capitalist Feedback Loops

I'm going to go into some more detail regarding my last post on what I call hell loops, which are self-reinforcing feedback loops in human social structures that serve two main functions to consolidate power in the form of control and to help manage existential discomfort in the face of life's uncertainty. The issue with these loops is that while they promise deliverance from discomfort and offer certainty in the face of change, these are illusions. No matter how hard one strives and the promised goodies are always on the other side of striving, submission, and more suffering, or how perfectly one adheres to the logic of the loop, one is left on the other side feeling dissatisfied and depleted, craving intensity, wondering why it's not working. To illustrate these loops and how they operate as well as offer a quick primer on how to navigate within them and outside of them because they are rather inevitable at least at this juncture.

I'm going to draw on three different texts, Julio Cortesar's B. Steary, David Chapman's Meaningness, and Stephen Bachelors living with the devil. If you want further information on these concepts, the latter two sources are excellent. B.

Steary is a short story by Argentine writer Julio Cortesar about a child Isabel who was sent to family friends for the summer as a companion for the family's young son, Nino. The Funes family lives in a grand rambling house on large grounds. Four members of the family share this abode with dogs, a conscientious caretaker, and a tiger. From the beginning of the story, the tiger is presented almost as an after thought, like an inconvenience.

The family simply navigates around it, always making sure to check its whereabouts before entering other rooms or parts of the grounds. It is taken as a given, and the whole of the family's life is organized around its avoidance. As the summer progresses, Isabel acclimates to the situation that she begins to resent it and to take out her resentment on the insects that she and Nino collect and catalog. Quote, it gave her immense pleasure to think that the ants came and went without fear of any tiger.

Sometimes she tried to imagine a tiny little tiger like an eraser roaming the galleries of the ant farm. Maybe that was why they dispersed and concentrated. And now she like to rehearse the real world in the one of glass, now that she felt a little like a prisoner, now that she was forbidden to go down to the dining room until the tiger left it. The fiend's family is soaked in uncertain sorrow and the story ends ominously, but the metaphor of the tiger and its controlling presence is an apt one for how hell loops seep into the structures of human life.

The tiger representing fear, uncertainty, and discomfort at the contingency of being controls the lives of the fiend's family. The tiger's presence never directly confronted or mediated over time, constricts what is available, locking the family into more and more rigid patterns which must inevitably break. This rigidity inspires Isabel to create a micro-loop of control over her ant farm, projecting the structure onto something she can feel agency over in turn. Steven Bachelor, a former Buddhist monk, white writes beautifully about hell loops in his book Living with the Devil, where he details the stories of Gothamabuda's dealings with the demon Mara.

A personification of the inducements we all experience when presented with a seductive reasoning of control and intensity, as well as the compulsion to retreat from existential discomfort. He describes the experience of being ascension being as, I am divided against myself. Part of me remains aware of how weird it is to be this self-conscious animal. Another part averts its gaze and flees to the security of what seems manageable.

I succumb to an insatiable fascination with trivia and gossip. I crave simulation and intoxication. I suffer an uncontrollable tendency to daydream, a chronic inability to remain focused on what matters most. In spite of lofty aspirations, I begin to suspect I am spinning in circles.

When we are stuck in compulsive cycles of reactivity, when we are fleeing from the largeness and unknowal-ness of being contingent beings who are subject to disease, pain, aging, and death, we tend to fall into rigid patterns of avoidance that promise us a fantasy of individual fulfillment and importance, fantasies that entrancise and soothe our anxieties, while fixating meaning on things that promise permanent satisfaction and security. For Gothamabuda, he encountered these both prior to and after his awakening up until his death. The personification of Mara as a demon differs from the Abrahamic interpretations of the devil in that Mara is not an external adversary, but an internal one. Mara's weapons, fear, craving, attachment, aversion, and self-doubt are all found inside us every time we try to face the tiger of our own contingency and discomfort.

This is where David Chapman's concept of stances in his ebook, Meaningness, can give us some great clues as to how to recognize and counter hell loops when we notice we are stuck in one, or if we're wondering how to navigate inside of a larger one that we can't easily exit like capitalism. For Chapman, a stance is a simple approach toward meaning that does not have any specific beliefs or practices, like nothing is meaningful, which is the stance of nihilism. A system, meanwhile, is a large, complicated pattern with many details that adherents are supposed to believe and follow, like a religion. Systems attempt to fixate or stabilize stances, which are by knee-joyed unstable, since they do not accommodate for the contingent, emergent aspect of existence and meaning.

This means that stances come in pairs. Most people spend a lot of time ping ponging between opposite sides of a stance spectrum. Chapman contrasts the unstable stances, which we can also think of as immature psychological defenses against existential discomfort with mature stances. Mature stances are those that, while they are not psychologically comforting in the way that immature stances promise yet fails to deliver on, are stable and account for the contingent, emergent, constantly shifting nature of life and meaning.

Let's do a quick rundown of three of these unstable immature stances in their mature counterparts. On the unstable spectrum, we would have eternalism and nihilism. In eternalism, everything is given a fixed meaning by an external ordering principle and in nihilism, nothing is meaningful. The mature stance to counter this would be meaning-ness, where we recognize that meaning is nebulous yet patterned, meaning and meaninglessness intermingle.

And so if you find yourself getting caught between self-righteousness and despair, don't argue or intellectualize on either side of the spectrum, do something completely unexpected. Just get yourself out of that loop. Watch a movie you loved as a child, stand on one leg for as long as you can, smell a flower and try to make up words for the smell. Even if what you do makes you feel frustrated or irritated, it's going to kick you out of a rigid loop of thinking.

Another unstable spectrum would be mission and materialism. So in mission, we say only higher, eternal, transcendent purposes have meaning. In materialism, we say only mundane, earthly, like status and wealth purposes have meaning. And the mature stance to counter this would be enjoyable usefulness.

So do things that are enjoyable and useful because all purposes can have meaning. And if you find yourself stuck in a loop about not making money or not doing the right things or being lazy, this is a really good way to think of how to counter that. So do something both enjoyable and useful either to yourself or to somebody else. A third unstable spectrum would be religiosity and secularism.

So in religiosity, we say the sacred and the profane are distinct and they're given by an outside authority and in secularism, nothing is sacred. Sacredness is a superstition. The mature stance to counter this would be vividness. So because nothing is inherently sacred, anything can be meaning can be experienced anywhere and in the presence of anything.

So be on the lookout for the strange and unusual, the wild, the woolly, the funny and the profound. It might be a beautiful cathedral that strikes you or particularly well-written bit of code or even a piece of junk at a swap meet. Beauty and meaning are absolutely everywhere if we can remain open to them. A good example of this is the artist Saithwamli who in his photography took photos of a lot of extremely mundane objects but through the photos really transmuted them into something sublime.

Learning to open up a bit of space between thought or feeling and then the response. Eventually enough space to choose how you want to respond to what presents itself is the best way to exit hell loops. Know these small actions will not in themselves bring down rigid power consolidation structures but over time they can free us from the attraction these loops hold and move more people away from rigid immature stances and systems. This was part of Gautama Buddha's insight when he faced Mara.

When Mara asked him what right do you have to enlighten it? Who do you think you are? Gautama pointed down and touched the earth essentially saying I'm here a part of all this and so I have as much right as any and so do we all.
