# Web Development Advice

You want to build an application or a website, I'm going to give you the cheat code, the workflow for how you can use AI or large language models to be able to work through this. So number one, you're going to always start with ChatGBT. And you start with ChatGBT because you can use voice detects and it has the best voice detects feature of all the chatbots. And so you're just going to use the mobile application.

I would say it has the best mobile experience of all the chatbots. And so you're just going to talk to ChatGBT as if you were explaining your idea to anyone. You're just going to work through it. Hey, this is what I wanted to do.

This is how I wanted to operate. And you're going to ask ChatGBT to work as like your business culture, idea, refinement partner. And so from that talking, that conversation that you're having, you should be able to get the problem that you're solving, the problem you're identifying, the customers who you want to be working for. Just get a long, a ton of information on product and customer.

Right? You're going to get all that information. You're going to ask ChatGBT to just summarize that and put that into a document, right? And this becomes like your foundation document for what your actual application does.

The next thing you're going to do is you're going to go and find inspiration. You're going to go find sites that are already doing it. You're going to screenshot those sites. If you're a little technical, you can go inside the development tools and like your Chrome browser and get like some of the HTML and CSS code.

But you're going to get inspiration for the layout for how your application is going to look. And then you're going to take your document that you got from ChatGBT. You're going to take all your inspiration and then you're going to plug that into cloud. You're going to do cloud because cloud has artifacts and it can render what this is going to look like before you even do any kind of coding, right?

You're going to put it in cloud. Cloud artifacts is going to render it. It's really good if you do it in SVG or basic took to HTML. Do not start having it code up, JavaScript and all the stuff.

Have it do it in a basic SVG. Show me what this will look like in HTML or SVG and then cloud artifacts is going to do it. After you get that. So now you have your users, your problems, inspiration, you have even a wireframe mockup.

Then you're going to ask cloud to hook you up with it's called mermaid code, right? The mermaid code is going to then create diagrams for how all of this flows to your application, right? You're going to start to describe the cloud. Hey, this is what I wanted to do.

This is how I wanted to work. Can you provide for me mermaid code that illustrates all of these diagrams, right? I'm telling you, you work through this process. So now you have a maybe like a PRD document is what it's called from Chad Gbt.

You'll have a wireframe, kind of a prototype, kind of a soft mockup from cloud. Then you're going to take all and then you have the mermaid documents or diagrams. Then you're going to take all of that information and you're going to plug it into lovable.dev or v0.dev. All those documents dump it in there and watch some of the magic happening.

You at the very least will have the front end for how this looks and works.
