# The Ruling Class as Abusive Parents

I'm tired, but I think one day we're gonna look back and realize that Sonic the Hedgehog instilled class consciousness and got the ball rolling. Why? Because when you think of the ruling class as the people as the sea sweets who enabled ugly Sonic every step of the way who Ocade all the marketing who ocade all of the millions of dollars for merchandise for special effects for the marquee that they put up for fucking Sonic all the promotional materials. They'll kid ugly Sonic every fucking step of the way.

Every step ugly Sonic. The working class said no. We said fucking no. You go back to the goddamn drawing board and you fix him right now.

You fix him. You make him look how he should look. So then the fucking studios they had to decide. They had to decide what do we do?

Do we push through and crash in burn with ugly Sonic or do we listen? Do we go back to the drawing board? Do we make what these people want? I don't understand.

What is this fucking blue hedgehog thing? But then somebody clearly on the inside the creatives were going, yeah, dude, what the fuck? We got a This is Sonic because then when they redid Sonic they go, it's perfect. Could you imagine?

Could you fucking imagine a trilogy of Sonic movies with ugly Sonic but not only with ugly Sonic with ugly tails ugly shadow? These people don't deserve to own the shit that we like in not just Sonic. I'm talking about the resources the means of production
