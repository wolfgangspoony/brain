# AI Criticism is Capitalism Criticism

Every single criticism of AI is actually just a criticism of capitalism if we choose to take it one step further, right? The issue that it is stealing from artists wouldn't fucking matter if artists didn't need to sell their work in order to survive. The issue that is bad for the environment would not be a fucking issue if we chose to invest in renewable energy infrastructure. The issue that it might take people's jobs would not be an issue if we didn't all have to work to survive.

And it frustrates me to no end when I see people get on this app and give takes like if you use AI you're a bad person like... fuck off dog. That's not reasonable. That's an incredibly reductive take and there's one that is anti-intellectual and anti-progress.

Like AI is capable of doing some absolutely incredible things like it is capable of detecting cancer months if not years before some of the best doctors in the world. It is capable of analyzing satellite imagery and telling us what efforts to focus where in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Like hell even fucking like speech to text dictation on my phone is convenient and I'm glad that I have it. So if your opinion is that like AI is bad I hate to say it but you've totally missed the mark.

And that's not to say that you don't have valid reasons for being concerned for being upset for wanting to have discussions about this. I think it is incredibly important that we have conversations about the ways in which any new or emerging technology interacts with the world around us. It's just important that we have those conversations in a way that we are pointing the finger in the right direction. Right?

The blame here doesn't lie with artificial intelligence as a technology. It does not lie with the concepts of machine learning. It lies with Sam Altman and OpenAI and Elon Musk and all of the people who are currently using this technology to push their economic and political agendas. So instead of saying AI is bad because it seals from artists I think it's much more worthwhile to have a conversation about how to craft robust intellectual property laws that protect smaller artists in a world where AI exists.

You know, instead of saying, oh AI is bad because it harms the environment I think it's much more important that we have a conversation about building robust renewable energy infrastructure. And instead of saying, oh AI is going to take my job I think it's much more worthwhile for us to have a conversation about why you need to work to survive in the first place. And it's totally okay if AI is our starting point for this conversation. It's totally okay if that's how we get into talking about these things.

It just can't be the ending point, right? Because AI isn't the issue here. Our economic system is and as long as we are pointing the finger at AI and not at the economic system we're just going to keep spinning our wheels. And that doesn't stand to benefit anybody except for the people in charge.
