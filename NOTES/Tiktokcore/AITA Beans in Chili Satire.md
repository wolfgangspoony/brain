# AITA Beans in Chili Satire

Am I the asshole for pretending to think beans in chili are... Woke to prank my cousin who was obsessed with being anti-woke and who loves chili. For the past two or three years, this cousin has become obsessed with all the bullshit about what is or isn't woke and about how woke things are the end of the world. The other weekend I was at his place and he was making his famous chili.

I got the idea for a little prank. I was like, surprised you still put beans in your chili. He was like, what? Why?

I was like, beans in chili are woke. And everyone's saying so. Many of those cases. I said something like, yeah, beans in chili are woke.

The original conservative Texans who made chili only use the meat. San Fran Liberals started adding beans to chili in the 60s because so many hippies were vegetarian. Now all the woke scientists are saying beans are a better protein source than meat. Yesterday I was back at his place and he was making his chili.

There were no beans. He's been making his chili with beans for 15 years. I was like, what's up? Where are the beans?

He was like, I don't fuck with that woke shit. Yeah. I said, what? He said beans in chili are woke.

Even you know that. Dude, I was just fucking with you. He got super angry. He texted me later and said, I researched this online and it turns out you really were like to me.

Beans are not woke. How could you do this? How could you do this to me? All my beans, God.
