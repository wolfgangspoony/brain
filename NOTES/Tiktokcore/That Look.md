# That Look

Why are you looking at me like that? Oh! What the fuck do? I could have sworn that you were ballin' up your fist ready to punch me in the face.

What the fuck are you talking about? I wasn't gonna punch you in the face. Now I am! Oh!

I fucking knew it. You see guys, I told you he was gonna fucking hit me. What? What?

You just came out of nowhere and fucking hit me. I know it. I know it. I know it.

I don't even know about money that he also has a knife and he's willing to stab me. First of all, I don't have a knife. Second of all, you have 27 knives on your belt. That is besides the point.

The knives I have may or may not fucking exist, but one thing is for sure, your little buddies, you've been sending fourth graders to fucking bite my ankles for the past nine weeks. I didn't send them! Do you mean because I taught those fourth graders how to fucking read? I'm responsible for them biting your ankles?

What the fuck? Hey, I've got the right to defend myself by any means necessary. Defend you! Starrn-ing-ing!
