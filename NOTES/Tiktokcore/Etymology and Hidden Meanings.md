# Etymology and Hidden Meanings

How old are you? 12. All right, so look, do you know why they call low income neighborhoods the projects? I mean, they really call it that because this is a project for corporate America.

What do you mean? If we've been real, bro, the project has been outdated like since 2000s, bro. Like if we're going to be real, we can that as cool at the cycle now, bro. The name project's been outdated since the 2000s?

Yeah, let's call it the cycle, bro. Because if you think about it, they've been recycling guns and drugs and a project for over 30 years now, bro. And I know for a fact is people with power poisoning are projects, bro. And it's so true because the CIA used to use drug money to like fund the military, which means they don't care about the people from inner cities, bro.

And it's only the key people of color, like down it out literally right after. Well, savory and sacred ratio ended. I so look, how do you like beat the projects? They got no bro.

I'm a little heavy little, bro. I just run down, you post the putt cereal before the milk. As long as we keep coming each other, the project is working, bro.
