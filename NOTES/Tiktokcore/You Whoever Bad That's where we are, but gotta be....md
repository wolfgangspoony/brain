# You Whoever Bad That's where we are, but gotta be...

You Whoever Bad That's where we are, but gotta be okay, gotta be good guys I'm gonna play it on the bed, okay None of me, you none of me, good guys I'm gonna play the night, right now Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it Prisoner, prisoner, lock the game So in the air, I don't care, I let it spill With a wrap I say you ain't worth company, I ain't worth it
