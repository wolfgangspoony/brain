# It IS That Deep - Depth vs Dismissal

And when the is not that deep crowd end up running up and down all 9th circles of Tartarus I want to make sure that the folks who involved in the surveillance state by a dating culture there as well Which means that a lot of women will be there and every time I have this conversation I get the same accusations did he pick you yet? I'm a pick me. I'm a male identified female as if they are not being agents of patriarchy by feminizing harm Because that's what it requires once you feminize an issue it is made less harmful Sociopolitically, I talk about this a lot when we look at healthcare and education But those realities don't bode well with vacuous arguments that rest in man equals irreparably damaged in evil women equals You know a reprobble victim and good a lot of space in between that's oftentimes not talked about Dating culture is one of them two years ago I made a video saying you did not need a red scare macarthiasm with the current dating landscape and folks told me I was Reachive but I feel like I'm proven right every time I hop on line two really big shifts happened at the same time that Emboldened the surveillance state within dating culture as well as built what y'all now hate called you know cancel culture I just considered digital vigilante as they have their same route their origins are the same which is abuse being Subsoomed with other considered anti-social behavior that is not abusive as well as this in measurement with surveillance as protection Which are perfect in a paranoid society prone to punish because we are living in a very carceral state And we find ourselves in this place where dating culture is just continued derivatives of Anti-privacy pro surveillance culture even if they had the best of intentions at first if we look at something like the are we dating the same guy Facebook groups which started as really small regional groups that were meant to be analogous to like the whisper networks You would have had in a small town a couple thousand years ago where women were going into be like this one is abusive This one assaulting me this one is violent etc Which is a net positive to be clear before y'all misgins through my words and then was proliferated by women who are not being abused to Air out the dirty laundry of men They did not like or men. They feel like didn't treat them well So it went from maybe having a thousand women in a are we dating the same guy Facebook group making sure they're not dating a Active abuser to now he wants to go 50 50 on dates and he refused to commit to me.

Let's air him out Once we get away from Facebook groups and reddit forms you end up on platforms like this where women will come on Have his whole face behind him the school that he went to what happened because now that she feels like she's been slited That's given her permission to literally dox people as if we have not dealt with the last 10 15 years of folks having built whole Platforms from doxing folk a very violent act a very carceral act mind you I will never forgive y'all for the way that you rationalize what happened in the west umk lab situation That was spooky to me a man refusing to commit to you and having multiple hookups at once is not licensed to dox Someone to potentially get them fired from jobs to make them lose their livelihood who were you protecting other than your own pride And so we take this culture that is subsumed the language of abuse Meaning they have turned everything that feels unsavory into abuse even when it is not use that rationale to argue as to why they are allowed to punish That is surveillance state shit that's cop shit and y'all can't clock it to save your life Whisperer networks only work when people are whispering once folks find out that the jig is up They dip they go underground everything you are worried about doesn't stop. It is just concealed better Tell people that all the time when you'll start running around screenshot and people's messages to you in dating apps talking about they were weird or cringey using that as an excuse to A.A. people out and then another girl goes to date him and then he's really strategic about what he says at the beginning because of stuff You've done you didn't make her safer. They're hiding it more But none of this clicks for y'all because of the clout because of the vindication Because of that really kind of small part of you that wants to get you a lick back And because of all the other women celebrating that behavior in your comments And then it turns into actual violence that has already been Manufactured as normal within the culture I will never forget that woman who drove her ex-fiance a down to Mexico So that he cannot get back into the country because he was undocumented and women were by and large supporting it That's the surveillance state that is the culture that is the panopticon everything that y'all claim to be afraid of you are doing in our faces Because you're afraid of being what a cheater because you don't want to get played I don't need to interrogate that way more in all context this behavior would be controlling It would be coercive it would be abusive but in pursuit of love It's not now privacy has been bled out of the culture in large due to dating etiquette and it's in measurement with the surveillance state The find my friends being weaponized against partners if you got for a bid try to date and have a boundary that you do not share These types of things with people your red flag.

What do you have to hide? Do you hear yourself? What world is that the appropriate response? I don't think my partners should have 24-7 access to me I'm still a person.

I have autonomy. I want to be able to move through the world unfettered Which must mean I'm hiding something It must mean I'm doing something wrong because why don't you want me to know every waking second if you're not doing anything wrong Who do you sound like you not sound like the surveillance state who was like if you're not doing crimes You shouldn't care what we see you're not doing anything wrong. Why do you care that we have all this footage of you like? We're in the bad place for so many reasons That is one of them and until more women interrogate that We will stay in the bad place Y'all will not be able to divorce yourself from surveillance culture And the worst part about it is that it does not make women safer It makes their abusers sabbier.

It makes the assaulters go underground and pluck off communities that are way less in franchises than you The LGBTQIA plus homeless youth the hose the undocumented the disabled are doing nothing But being a vigilante and if thinking that makes me a pick me I Guess
