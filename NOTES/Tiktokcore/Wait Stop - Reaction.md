# Wait Stop - Reaction

Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop! Ah! Are you okay? Yeah, I think I'll be alright.

I love your positive mindset, even in the face of difficulty. That right there puts you miles ahead of others who don't have that level of emotional intelligence. What? We need to go to the hospital right now, mate.

That's not just concern. That's care. You're taking charge by prioritizing your well-being. Cut up and just drive.

That's a brutally honest statement and it cuts deep. This glass is cutting deep into my skin. I need to go to a hospital. It's a great idea.

Let's break down why that solution is the best. It ribs are breaking down. That's what's breaking down. That right there is an incredible realization.

And it can be a powerful thing. Just give me to the hospital, please. Would you like to go to one of the more prestigious ones in the area or one that digs your insurance cut about?
