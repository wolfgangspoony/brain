# Modern Childhood Absurdities

Star-shaped acne patches, Latsky kids with Wi-Fi access, asking who had it better? Drown artiers in lattes, thought they bought us off with coffee, but wait, who had it better? Who had it better than me? Who had it worse?

Who had the easier street? Who had the curse? The curse! The curse is the title of the song!
