# Men and Emotional Drama

Men, why are you so dramatic and emotional? Oh. Growing up, my dad was my hero. Everything I needed him to be, he was there for me.

He showed up for me from the time of my infancy up until I reached puberty. I never understood or knew until I was older. That he was a struggling alcoholic. He had a lot of problems.

And as I came to my own senses, I started seeing a lot of his problems. I saw his mental health and how it affected him. It made me not want to be around him. He further isolated himself from everyone around him.

He became a shell of a man. He died two years ago in assisted living and in spite of me trying to build a bridge with him, trying to create some kind of relationship. Later on, showing him, like with action, after he apologized, I did forgive him. The relationship wasn't there.

The day he died, my grief overwhelmed me. And that wasn't because of the relationship I had with him. It was because I was mourning the man he didn't get to be. And the society he grew up in was one that stigmatized men's mental health.

What are you doing? Why are you so emotional? Sound familiar? Why are you being so dramatic?

That's what men grew up with. Like you have no room to feel anything. You have no room to talk about your feelings. None.

I think that we as women today are overcompensating for how silence and ignored we felt and how we finally feel like we have a voice to talk about mental health. I was an outpatient treatment for extreme postpartum depression. Both my kids have ADHD. I have ADHD and my oldest son is on the spectrum.

For the number of years I've been in therapy, I might as well get my degree because it is such a passion of mine. I will forever advocate for mental health for everyone. Not only for my generation, but for generations to come, Gen Z, Gen Alpha, I've done extensive research on Gen Z mental health. We usually talk in use language about breaking cycles and no longer being in the position that our ancestors were in.

But the way that I see this response on here, it saddens me. It just heartens me. This should be a slow down moment. Why don't I care about mental health?

What is it about mental health that triggers me so much? Yes, there are men who go on this app or on YouTube or wherever they go with a microphone bashing women. Can I tell you friends that those are the minority? That there are men who genuinely care and who genuinely want to stick up for women, but are told again and again by society that they don't matter.

Their voice doesn't matter. We're trying to overcompensate for how women have been treated over the years to an extreme swing of the pendulum. That's not in the right direction. I think that if we want to break ground on doing better, it takes self-reflection, asking hard questions on the why, having the humility to learn, to understand, and to grow.

I have met in my life that I love with all my heart. I love my husband. I love my son so much. And I hope that we're setting an example of what it means to be honest and talk about our feelings, to be transparent when things are hard.

My hope is that we don't have to continue in this way. So do we want to break cycles or do we want to repeat the same mistakes? And I hope that we don't fall into the category of the latter.
