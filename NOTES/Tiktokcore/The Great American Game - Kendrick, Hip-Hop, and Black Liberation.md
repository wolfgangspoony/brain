# The Great American Game - Kendrick, Hip-Hop, and Black Liberation

Check out this video you can be good at any game if you understand the rules and how to play the game The industry man, it's not the same doesn't have to do with talent. It's about playing the game Why don't you join the team man team man? I'm not playing any games The environment that we embedded in puts us in a situation where we feel we have to maneuver and play the game and and water our message down I try to be my best to do it for y'all and get your greatest game some of y'all gonna get it I know some of y'all want to change but the environment don't allow you you just don't have the finances They really move outside of the poverty and the conditions that we box the fucking two It's your uncle Sam and this is the great American game I'm giving that to him back powering up no more shakes and hugs the energy only second late through us Be judge but this time guide only favoring us this is It's a great American game. This is where the game begins in the box You break out of the box when you learn from those who've escaped You learn how to play the game from those who know the game well and then try to give that game to you because game Rightist game is meant to be shared You see how they want an anti-diversity, but they lose they mind when it's all black the coach range is Being black I can't I can't help that man.

It's just not something that I think about or even try to like go I'm black. I'm at a point of my life. I can't I can't necessarily fake the funk for nothing I have to be who I am authentically and if you know the world can accept that then so be it I'm gonna put it all the way out there, you know whether it's in private or whether it's on the main stage Let me explain to you something about economics in America We must never forget that economics was the reason that black people were brought to this country We came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north. That's what we came to do There are no major white characters in your books No, what is interesting to me is what is going on within the community and Within the community there are no major white players The Billboard Hot 100 started in 1958 adding the pressure of charting to the music game and the first black artist Areas that pedicule was Tommy Edward who went number one with his R&B record It's all in the game which was about the sometimes heartbreaking game of love and he held that position on the chart for about six weeks Which is some proof that we've been talking about the game in a lot of different ways for generations Fast forward to 2025 not like us by Kendrick Lamar which held the number one spot for 22 weeks and in that song He offers to put the listener on game making a direct connection between the exploitation of black labor in American history and the exploitation of black Artist labor in the music game once upon a time all of us was in chains.

Call me still double down calling us some slaves We have to change you like America's Always wrapping like you body get the slaves free The Atlanta was the mecca building railroads and trains bear with me for a minute Let me put you all on game the railroads made it Atlanta the railroads were just as important to Atlanta back in those days as the airports are today Before Atlanta was called Atlanta It was known as terminus because it was on the spot where the new Western and Atlantic railroad ended For 2024 you got the same You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance. Let me back it down for you This is the real African American rappers saying inward this and inward that but a Caucasian can't so say Say what say the word do want to say I'm not saying that I want to say it. I'm just saying that I can't so you can say it say right now I will say it with the black history lesson at the end of not like us was overlooked by most But it's at the end of the song for a reason a cap is exactly why this is deeper than a music Tommy Edwards saying of the game of love, but there's also the American game of life the rap game the street game the street game is a game Majority of the people lose the game All in the game. Oh Hands were reminded that Michael Jordan had it for the love of the game clause in his NBA contract that freed him to play the game He loved whenever he wanted we even say phrases like game recognize game like we see in this example basketball hip hop right it's like they're married Is there someone on the court that he reminds you of yeah, it was me The same hunger look like step out there in the court taking heads off.

It's not it's not there's no I don't want to hear it like I want to hear Michael's the best player in the world I want to hear they call them black Jesus. I want to hear that Go out to show me All right, let me just skip that And the game the rule is always look beyond what you see and everything about the game no matter what 20 or force to play require strategy And diligence every great American game involves deception and it's rarely if ever played fairly and at this point in American history With all that we face I think so many of us are tired of playing the long game racism doesn't go away Based on one vote or one administration the way you make progress is But making things better a little bit of the time and then over time Those little differences become big differences I was born here almost 60 years ago. I'm not gonna live another 60 years You always told me it takes time It's taking my father's time my mother's time Uncle's time my brothers and my sister's time when he says in my nephews time how much time do you want for your progress? If I right now decided that I wanted to play Monopoly with you and for 400 rounds of playing Monopoly I didn't allow you to have any money.

I didn't allow you to have anything on the board I didn't allow for you to have anything and then we played another 50 rounds of Monopoly and everything that you gained And you earned while you were playing that round of Monopoly was taking from you that was Tulsa that was Rosewood Because you're writing have a political point of view the truth I have to be most interested in has to do with the nature of oppression and how people Survive it or don't it's amazing to me particularly for African-Americans just amazing that we're not all dead. That's a constant Shucker When Kendrick Lamar said the revolution about to be televised picked the right time but the wrong guy That is a revised version of a quote by poet musician and activist Gil Scott Heron which came out in 1971 Not be televised What that was all about is revolution will not be televised That was about the fact that first change that takes place in your mind that thing is going to change people There's something that no one will ever be able to capture on film. It'll just be something that you see and all the thing you realize I'm on the wrong page or I'm on the right page But I'm on the wrong note and I've got to get in sync with everyone else to understand what's happening So why did Kendrick say the revolution will be televised? Gil Scott Heron released his song in 1971 when having a television was a luxury This was 10 years before the internet was invented in 30 years before social media And while the hard-of-intimestive remains true that revolution isn't about what you watch It's about being transformed by the renewing of your mind.

It's about what happens inside of you We still witness people in 2025 because of the internet and because of social media Advocate share an act to have gone through that transformation who are doing that internal work who televised that Transformation in the hopes of changing or impacting others and that's what this whole moment was from beginning to end It was a hip-hop revolution. It's another thing when you talk about a revolution most people think violence without realizing that The real content of any kind of revolutionary thrust lies in the in the principles and the goals that you're striving for Not in the way you reach them Gil Scott Heron is considered by many to be a godfather of modern hip-hop music his poetry laid over Soulful reduction words said with message and intention helped to guide a new group of young poets and messengers into the global movement We now know as hip-hop Gil was with so much emphasis now. It seems unspoken word music With hip-hop and rap going to the heights that they were suddenly Gil Scott Heron who was never a part of the mainstream Is the mainstream is that where you? You got a great Those words and that music when they go together That's a sound.

It's not a hip-hop all around Gil Scott Heron saw that hip-hop would be a gateway to connect with a new generation of young people And he also knew that music had the power to reach people in ways that other forms of communication could not and you Wonder how people who grow up in the Bronx are ever going to see anything but the face of the tenement building ahead of them Oh, I was in the Bronx the songs are the best the best big crumbs I Can leave Along the way not not for going back But for people who who want to follow what that knowledge he offered game to the budding him sees in his poem turned song message to the messenger released at 1994 Older folks in our neighborhood got plenty of know how you got to remember that it wasn't for them You wouldn't be here now We got respect for young rappers in the way they freeway and but if you want to make a real impression Be sure you know what you're saying If you want to be responsible for a whole generation and you know enough to take care of that education Be sure you understand about the past situations and I just Repeat them once you heard on the local TV station But sometimes they take lives and put them in a tooth with this guy That's why we said it when we tell a lot Three days after Kendrick Lamar was announced his headliner of the Super Bowl half-time show and on the same day that the MTV video music awards aired Kendrick released an untitled song that we call watch the party die and in that song he gave his own kind of message to the Messenger as an elder in the rap game It was a song they talked about the state of hip-hop and called for major change in how hip-hop music is created and promoted With the focus on the feature of the youth it was a rallying cry for the truth tellers and those who seem to edify Uplift and form and offer hope to emerge and reclaim the soul of the art form that we know was hip-hop If you parade in gluttony without giving truth today youth the graveyard is company just tell us what cast get the truth Yes In that song watch the party die speaks to the cultural divide that Kendrick Lamar was talking about at the Super Bowl half-time show It's about the lives and history of black folks in America about the broken promises we've endured about how everything meant to Serve us and aid in our liberation has been taken away from us and labeled evil its recognition that resistance is needed It's why he's calling for soldiers to assemble and watch the party die and why he says it's not enough in TV off G and X was a resistance project Someone better squat on love So I'm many seem to be lamenting the new Drake project where he's trying on a different accent and making anti-intellectual commentary I can't help but think about who tried to put us on game about what his rise to fame meant for the state of hip-hop culture Oh, this is great. It's a new Drake you hear it. It's great Okay What happens when this thing collapses what happens when the columns Start buckling are we not in some early stage of that at This present hour buying and selling where's the message that I can use what's in it for your audience apart from being Like banging the palm palms For a long time hip-hop culture has been accused of being altogether distasteful disruptive disgusting News commentators have even said that hip-hop has done more harm to young african-americans than racism in recent years Hip-hop has done more damage to black and brown people than Then racism in the last Ten years all this is said yet hip-hop is still distributed globally by America It's one of America's biggest exports We all had the same reaction when Serena Williams was dancing on that stage because a lot of us remember how she was torn apart Right the media for doing this very dance at Wimbledon Yeah Barbie movie used hip-hop to market it so Captain America Brave New World ended in a Kendrick Lamar song was playing at the end Kirsten Bell walked out to Kendrick at the screen actor's Guild Awards the NBA a league that once antagonized plays for being too hip-hop Players like Allison Colts too loud too reckless too ghetto for wearing streetwear and making rap music and were forced to tighten up By wearing suits to basketball games from NBA commissioner David Stern who said notwithstanding The music's wide popularity Alan Iverson by even recording his lyrics has done a disservice to himself The sexers teammates perhaps all NBA players that same NBA is now using hip-hop almost exclusively in its marketing I'm my swerving that corner wall Oh And that same hip-hop have time show that so many called the boring it's still somehow the most wide Super Bowl have time show of all time But this is the great American game it involves deception Even if I made it deceitful and I made you think that the answer is over here, but the answer is really over here I'm still going to be looking over here Me the one that trick because I know this is the right answer Dr. Markle of my hill talked about this about how they deceive black folks They demonize us they attack us while at the same time using us because they know that they have nothing without us America's understood what you're capable of and they will make you think you ain't nothing at the same time that they Explore show gifts they'll tell you you lazy and make you a slave They'll tell you you dirty and have you clean a house They'll tell you you uncivilized and we raised their children In this reality is a direct reflection of the great American game when it comes to black music It's a game they played well for every black music art form that came out of struggle and oppression and resistance to that oppression Including the blues jazz music country rock and roll and now hip-hop the game is played in three stages stage one Demonization this is when the art forms attacked and criticized by the people who don't understand it at the beginning They even have us black folks participating in that attack largely using religion a great example is how so many black folks were attacking Tupac at the same time that uncle sam was but for very different reasons vice president dan quail has renewed his attack on hollywood Now the target is rap lyrics which quail charges have led the violence There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published A via responsible corporation mr.

quail wants the record taken off shelves He said take my shit up off the shelf now if that ain't hitting me what is I'm talking about the vice president of the country you live in He know me he won't my shit up off the shelf not motherfucking mega-beth Not kill a cop they killed us of me Young pot you know why because my shit is different than the next man my shit talk about swinging back They know the difference between mines and the next man stage two white adaptation and commercialization By the time they realize this music isn't a fat and isn't going away they begin to participate in it They begin to use it to sell their products their sports leagues etc And this is part of the deception they call hip hop this tasteful in ghetto But they're using the ghetto to sell their products all the society is doing is leaching off the ghetto They use the ghetto for their pain for their sorrow for their culture for their music And stage three is institutional takeover and erasure This is probably the most violent part of the american game when it comes to black music They set up industries and takeover industries and fill them with people who don't look like us to sell black music back to us Because again black people don't make the right kind of country or rock or blues music So they have to take it over and purify it It's for example why the response to Beyonce releasing a country album is a local newspaper putting on an op-ed about keeping country clean You know what you've got about that? You know what you've got about that This is a game that has worked well in every black music art form And it's a process that takes about 40 to 60 years hip hop being just past its 50th year This is around the time where they try to finalize the erasure of hip hop culture You hate me don't you you hate my people you plan to Determinate my culture you can evil I don't been on the same record label for 13 years so to say That record label just folded all it is independent labels and subsidiaries into each other which mean how we was kids You got Rockefeller you got dev jam you got all these things none of them exist no more They fired all the hazardous labels and if they didn't they turned them in the glorified A&Rs they cut off 50% of the people who work in all these departments most of those people is us people the color that come from hip hop And are in being these other things right then you got record labels opening up IPOs You got record labels destroying their relationships with TikToks Spotify things that pay our artists because they want to start their own So then we get priced out of our contracts. We get priced out of our imprints There are no labels basically that are incentivized to sign black music and it's happening in front of our eyes The industry worked to effectively remove black consciousness from the mainstream And one of the ways they did this is by separating so-called conscious hip hop from mainstream hip hop And this is done despite the fact that hip hop is born in birth from consciousness and uplifting the struggles of black folks hip hop Changing from positive to negative was not a consequence of history It had nothing to do with the changing of the times had everything to do with the fact that there are people In this particular society Who wants to see us exactly where we are fight the power ex-class Brand-newbian you had these groups out here who were pushing who were politically Orient and black kids into in the right direction. This is where we were the most coveted article of clothing was a Historically black college a university sweater We were motivating children towards positive attitudes and lifestyles Fast forward to our day Sean Bellish out 50 times in the street in New York By police officers number one song on the radio like a lollipop Nobody do nothing just like the brother.

I believe it was JT the bigger figure who said that The label executives came to him and said yo brother We need you talking about guns and horse Now I mean that happens. I've been in those meetings with management and had to ask me is what you're saying really what you believe So that we'll know how to market you properly the environment that we embedded in puts us in a situation But we feel we have to maneuver and play the game and and water our message down You know, I mean, but know what happened was they intentionally shifted the paradigm to get us exactly where we are right now The colonialism has attacked it of taking the criminal element of a society and insulting it as the leader stage And this is how all Cultures how they did us as they came in any city any state is colonized They don't take the king or the queen of the culture and insult them because you colonize it They let any taken but they got they'll take the one who is the lowest level of your culture Discluttered care follow principles don't care about history lesson and bless them And bring them up before the people So when we fast forward and see Drake and Compton with the game and he's on 100 saying I would have all of your fans If I didn't go pop and I say those I'm conscious which many believe was a direct shot at Kendrick in his hometown You see that culture divide represented in plain sight and knowing that backstory when you hear Kendrick say a new for you I make music that electrifier. I'm you make music that pass up. I am it reflects the sentiments that two pie had very early on about art being made that Passifies the people.

It's why those who love this culture who come from it can't go exclusively by record sales and billboards It's what we mean when we say they want our rhythm but not our blues Seller I'm down with him because he's a brother and he's making his male But however, he's diluting rap, you know, I'm saying he's making something he's playing that sand bow roll And the reason everybody's mind is record is because he's no threat and everybody want to see sand bow dance Remember you are silent in all black issues Drake you really are You are really really silent. I don't hear about anything. You don't stand for nothing. You don't say nothing about nothing You don't you and you got you have all the platform in the world There's a point in the performance where all the colors are on their field And then we see people wearing all black trapped in the game for the most part And if you looked beyond what you saw you would have seen a custom flag being flown for Sudan and historic Palestine They along with the Congo are facing the world's most dire humanitarian crises and this man starts to bring awareness to them He appeared on the screen with the flag about 10 times in active solidarity that reflects the words of street poets like black thought Who said it's a struggle worldwide?

I'm positive The ghetto might as well be the gods of strip He's last seen on the screen when Kendrick was performing TV All and the timing is crazy because right after that Kendrick says they only get it for saving face. I seen the cosmetics I'm prophetic they talk about it. Hi, daddy good for saving face and seeing the cosmetics Here's I gotta take the level my aesthetics hurry up and we watch in the cosmetics and 4k The man who flew that flag said that he saw an in Kendrick performance and wait to stand in solidarity with his other Persmosum siblings He saw it as a way to act at Kendrick Lamar's already important messaging Is this the culture of degeneracy that's ruining the youth? The situation in the Congo is dire Situation in Sudan is gross Normalizing this type of barbarity and making children subject to it.

I probably for my Harvard teachers That's if you see it wrong if you see it wrong doing or you're aware of a wrong doing you must stop it with your hands And if you can't stop it with your hands stop it with your tongue speak out against it And if you can't stop it with your tongue try to stop it with your heart meaning pray about it And we know that's the weakest of faith It was clear to me with the with the signs of the show that Kendrick had the American flag and human bodies at his PG laying flags And it was also sign many signs for me to show those flags to show how we're all connected The oppressed around the world see hip hop as a way to communicate to other oppressed people in their native languages It's why for example hip hop was used to raise awareness about apartheid South Africa And that is the tradition that this music industry that this society is actively misrepresenting and criminalizing Laughter and claps echo through the air as women and children swayed and twerled to the beat I started listening to rap four years ago and a few months after the war erupted I start composing songs Most of the songs that compose where for the place I love the most and where I grew up which is under mine The biggest wish I hope for is for the war to stop For me to be able to complete my studies and become a skilled surgeon and a famous rapper It is difficult. I know, but I think I'll be able to do both The These young people are connecting to the generosity they connect into a people to a struggle Every time everybody who's tried to live, you know, you go through your life for a long time. You think that No one is ever suffered the way I've suffered You know my god and then you realize you read something you hear something And you realize that your suffering does not isolate you And your suffering is your bridge that many people have suffered before you Many people are suffering around you and always will And all you can do is bring it hopefully a little light into that suffering So the person who is suffering can begin to comprehend his suffering And begin to live with it And begin to change it And this is the kind of information that gets suppressed once the art form that is considered a fed becomes an asset an extractable resource This is the great American game. Are we under resource when we possess one of the greatest resources for economic Progress in the world 142 billion dollar industry.

We're not under resource community. We're over extract the community It's like the African proverb everything the village needs is already in the village It's like everything else. Africa was fun to natural resources, but they go All the diamonds they came and got all the gold they came and got it all the They came and got it. Yeah, I mean it's the Consonant is the grape of all this resources Everything we have is already amongst us We've just been blocked out of the lanes to exploit our own intellectual property our own cultural resources I'm guessing where they call it is colonialism You know the same thing going on with rap music the same thing going on with all of our culture If they've a month to see it as a asset or as a resource We don't got no no no means to go get it.

He's got millions of dollars institutions set up Like the LAPD like the feds like the FBR all this is they army and they army Make it to where you can inflict your will. That's what we lack. Yeah, I mean We don't have no army that's gonna come protect our natural resources So with a soldier said the ones that lost their dollar learn to learn from that a thirst for life Heading inside the book because he concerned with that If selling this last but is not enough you better reach that but is not enough Yo culture cheap Scorekeeper deduct one life Dedication you know Kendrick said that his man else said do a song with nip He had better kryp a Kendrick said he a man first. Yeah, you know, he hit with he speaks about from black businesses And prison is and he said listen closest bigger than deuces and for so what is a better kryp?

What did that mean? I don't know cuz I ain't said but what I would assume Kendrick meant was that somebody that Is not 100% biased Or outside of Communicating with a blood or somebody from the other side of the tracks. Maybe that's what he meant That's what I took it as you know nipsey hustle called himself the two-pock of his generation He embraced the expected image of himself in those who look like him and used that as a bridge to connect to people that the society Disposes of he built bridges bought back the block Established black businesses establish resources for black youth all through hip hop and he did it strategically He really was doing God's work. That's one of the reasons I was so vocal about where I was coming from and and what I represented Because I know I know who I wanted to mobilize you know what I mean?

And I'm gonna name my last album and spoke to say about a door. I feel like I'm doing God's work You know, I'm saying just because I don't have nothing to pass around for people to put money in the bucket Don't mean I ain't doing God's work. I feel like I'm doing God's work. I'm running my Massage to impact gang culture.

Mm-hmm. You know, I'm saying I wanted what I had to say to impact Individuals like myself young people. I was in these areas. I was controlled by gang banging You know, I'm saying because these ghetto kids ain't got children and I don't see no missionaries coming through there You know, I'm saying so I'm doing God's work while Reverend Jackson Do his up in the middle class and he go to the White House and have dinner and pray over the president I'm up in the hood.

You know, I'm saying doing my work with my folks. The kids are only hope It I got to them before they could jailed or killed or turned in the dozens And now they'll do anything to be free When our words act like it's great, but it's not confirmation of success for me You know, I'm saying going out here and then Looking at a kid that say uh, this song changed my life. I was going to do something to myself last night You know, but I popped this tape and that's confirmation you didn't send so if you parade and gluttony without giving truth today The graveyard is company just tell us what casket the truth said We're threatening by that book all his people used to call him uncle Tom and the cool you know I'm set loud. Yeah, but he was there working for them the whole time.

Yeah And just in terms of being able to mobilize his homies Everybody saying because we choose to be organized now that we are handling the Italians We got organization because we peak game Kendrick talk about it in dedication. We had a convoy at the park premiere All of us represent our tribes But we can coexist in the music space and if that could happen in music And this is what the continuation of that work looks like That's a world see this You ain't seen as many sections on one stage keeping it together and having peace. Hold up You're in the from each side of my L.A. Crips blood power rules is special man We put together just a y'all I'm talking about every hurtful The Sean love and the second each other And this is exactly how I thought my students wanted to see Black unity black community is the cheat code that this society punishes us for Martin Malcolm Marcus nipsy pock you try to muster In the scorekeeper to ducks lives Samuel Jackson turn scorekeeper deduct one life and that that thing hit me hard because that is what happens that is part of the game You should you should know that That's one of the reasons that it's sometimes scary to stand up is scary to be different because whenever you build community They usually deduct one life deduct one life and is and is wild to hear Samuel Jackson deliver that line because Samuel Jackson was a usher At Martin Luther King's funeral I So with the Super Bowl halftime show when Kendrick Lamar is wrapping man at the garden with his homies behind him dressed in white We can see why this is personal for him you probably heard by now what those men likely represent I mean Kendrick tells us in a wack down murals that he lost 16 people each person somebody's everything Each person a universe and many of the ones he didn't lose survived the fixed game designed to suffocate them Because of the music we survived outside off from the music What so it feels like his response to last name apple first name greatest is Tell me why you deserve the greatest of all time what the This is personal because for those who come from struggle this is life or death black art at its most authentic is deeply personal My grandma used to say what is joke to you is debt to me It's why he demanded respect for the art form of the Grammys like he was even ready to tear somebody up I just hope you respect the art form.

That's all I respect the art form Get you where you need to go. It's why he was going at not only just Drake But the entire music industry during this back and forth Industry tool if you have been in this industry 12 years I'm a tell y'all one little secret It's on here corn on and somebody's hard right for you like it Like you are but the industries cook as I pick the cork is a part Yes, trying to see Compton the industry can hate come on in the mama. How many I should get it? The industry man, it's not the same Doesn't have to do with talent.

It's about playing the game You probably noticed in the crowd that right when Kedrick Lamar is about to go into euphoria The sign of the state says warning wrong way the disson playing the game the wrong way But it's like DMX said the industry like wait, but it just eats me like get him Seventeen have been that thing Get them sleeping hit them Make headwings and then proud The age of truth is not one year. It's it's the beginning of people having more of a thirst for what is true than An appetite for lies if you have truths to tell people are hungry for that and they'll pay you handsomely To hear the truth That's the battle that's going on is people who profit from the manipulation of others By getting you to believe something that's not the case And that's how they make their living And it is now a difficult time for those entities What happens when the game that you love the game that saved your life becomes tampered with what happens when it becomes unrecognizable The game that saved my life so it bore me and my family out a lot of boys so I'm just like grateful for it What happens when the love the passion the energy that she poured into the game right to sleep is met with contempt When those around you even those who are supposedly on your team don't seem to love the game as much as you do I passed the ball court blood court blood taste the shot From the corner misses it it goes down lays it up first team wins. I'm now let Corey have it He's like, hey man, it's just a game. I'm not a game.

I And I went back in the locker room. I was like, I may be cut a little different. Maybe it's just a game I can't get over it. Why can't I get over this day like they left went home?

I'm still thinking about it the next day. Why don't you join the team man team Man, I'm not playing any games Our support he died was Kenthal Maher's declaration at the game as we know it in hip hop is over It was a declaration that hip hop is resisting the fate that our other black means of traditions have suffered With the tools given to us one of them being the rat battle It was a declaration that what we built Cannot be torn down if we're ready to reclaim what is rightfully ours The world will change because it has to change The party is over TV off and squabble up our resistance songs Wacked out mirrors is a statement of intent songs to call up the leaders and the truth tellers in the moment that we find ourselves in The games started to collapse when people began to see for themselves The brutal reality behind the constant distractions and misinformation So I ask now, what are your passions? What is the thing that sustains you and what like minded individuals? Can you find alignment with the service of the greater good of the people?

He can do some things that you can Each one is called for what they are called for but for people that are not called to actually having to fight in that way Then support the advancement of humanity. I know I can't try I can't run a bank I can't count I can't believe it and I can't believe the movement But I can fuck up your mind During the Super Bowl halftime show there was a lot of commentary made about Kendrick Lamar's chain Which was a double entendre and his jeans but what set out to me as a writer is his jacket I think his jacket itself is one of the more important elements of the performance And of the overall story that he was telling He wore a martine rose jacket with his hometown on the back of it As well as the name of his production company PG Lang And on the front of the jacket and bold red letters is the word Gloria Which is the name of the last song in his most recent project I would describe the song Gloria as a love letter to the art of writing Gloria is actually the name of his pen in this song They can't erase our history They march in same big enough They all led by bigotry My woman in my right hand My saint in my sin Ain't no bitch like my b***h Cause my b***h be my pin The jacket felt like a reminder that writing got him here And that feels so significant in this moment we find ourselves in There was a time in this country where black people reading and writing was illegal When black writers had to reassure their audience that they in fact wrote their own work That's why these writers kept writing written by himself Written by herself Feel as weakly Frederick that because they thought niggos couldn't read and write They thought niggos didn't have the capacity to read and write And yet they made all the laws to stop us from learning how to do what Read and write So if you know hip-hop You understand why writing your own words and talking about your own lived experiences was so important And why that was a major theme in the talks around this moment in hip-hop history It's because keeping it real being honest is a pillar in this culture Telling the truth Because in doing so not only do you set yourself free but you help others get free as well James Baldwin had this very conversation with a young niggie Giovanni Why do we as black writers seem to be so hung up in the truth if I can I'm asking this as a younger person Because responsible labor writers is excavate Only where I can find Again the experience of the people who produce them because active writing Is the intention of it The root of it Is liberation This is why no tyrant in history was able to read But every single one of them Burned the books We live in a nation of declining literacy rates Our kids are struggling to read and write The arts Music and creativity are often considered are waste by the education system And they're often the first to go with budget cuts But so many black writers and poets have emerged through hip-hop I am one of them My name is Donnell writes for a reason Every word that you hear me speak in this video I wrote And I learned the skill of writing for an audience First it's because of hip-hop I made a world of making differences Clients real and efficient And I shift in the camel disguise I'm a militiam in disguise or I'm reaching the tide My machine is getting the seed of aid Because I'm above to make them live again Boy, cut the industry day Taking my energy gain Tanks in my enemies Can't hang in contend with me Rap has always been a scholastic pursuit for me I learned how to rap in school That's where I hone my skill sets That's why I learned everything that I do now So it shouldn't be lost on the importance of a black writer performing at the Super Bowl halftime show While he's wearing clothing dedicated to his pen into the craft of writing And that's even if the wider public struggles with seeing the legitimacy Of black writing, of black art, of hip-hop Rapp rate nothing but rhythm and poetry Those words and that music When they go together That's a song that's not a hip-hop song around It's poetry No one yet believes really Is there such a thing as a black writer A black writer is still a freak You know It may be even a dancing dog We don't yet exist in the imagination of this century And we can't under for the play games There's too much to stake My hope is that we can continue to lean into our passions in this moment And lean into our imaginations for the world that we have yet to see Tanaashi Kouta talks about how the tradition of writing Of drawing out a common humanity is indispensable to our future If only because what must be cultivated and cared for Must first be seen He wrote this book the message thinking of young writers Whose task he says is nothing short of doing their part to save the world Jolyan encourages us in his book to write all the poems now And often break them open with your teeth with a pen Poetry will be our greatest soundtracks Our ears to the streets He wrote these words in his book Everything and nothing at once Which is among other things a love letter to hip-hop Poems are slaying dragons he says They are saving us even still Our poetry will save the world The only thing that serves us now is community Rootering compassion Honesty and vulnerability Because while the art itself can be revolutionary It was never meant to do the work Art can absolutely save your life I believe it from the bottom of my heart But believe me when I tell you That entertainment will never be your salvation Entertainment by and large is escapism And no one has ever escaped their chains by forgetting they were there I think it was a phenomenal show especially in a year And a time where there are people that would have black history disappear And so if you really want to see a different neighborhood A different country A different world You probably have to turn a TV off Love and liberation to us all And as always I can follow from work on time They did a message in hip-hop Inflinch the world So this is the power of hip-hop You can look back and say that there are so many things that can motivate me And drive me to want more And to be the best You know why do I just keep getting up and going and going and going But I had a purpose before everybody had an opinion And I was like, I'm gonna sing this song at this point And you got none to do with no back and forth Braggers You got everything to do with this moment right here That's what the fuck is about To bring God to us the most Yeah, that's what the fuck is about
