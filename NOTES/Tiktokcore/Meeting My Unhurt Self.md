# Meeting My Unhurt Self

Today I met the version of myself that never got hurt. I saw him briefly on my way to work. He didn't have any lines in his arms, bags under his eyes. He was dressed a little less.

You kind of had a soon time. I thought, man, I'm just going to be that guy. Then I started to think about the difference between me and him and how all my losses led to my wins. And we were still on the same sidewalk.

We shared the same jaw, had the same money, shared the same boss. He was a winning. I hadn't lost. He just didn't have to deal with the rivers I crossed.

In fact, in that moment, that's kind of product who I was. I'm proud of everything I had and spied everything I almost didn't. And I realized something you will never feel the gravity of your own pain because you'll never meet the version of yourself you didn't have it. You'll never understand how impressive it is to overcome what you overcame because you'll never meet the version of yourself you've never had to overcome it.

Today I met that version of myself on my way to work. And only then did I appreciate my hurt.
