# America's Descent - DEI, Immigration, and the Coming Class War

You know what's hilarious? The group of people that I'm going to describe right now and probably for the rest of time as I speak about American politics will be they who must not be named. But you know who I'm talking about. So they who must not be named don't understand.

They're winning a couple of battles right now, but they're about to lose the war immensely immensely. And this is all due to their ignorance and it's to give them enough short wins in this whole like destruction of American society to make them feel like, hey, I can trust these people who are destroying our government. They're helping us real Americans win, right? Right?

Okay, let me tell you how that's wrong. You know, I told you a couple weeks ago that the destruction of the Department of Education can only mean one thing. I mean, I hope I said this back then, but to me right now, it means you're trying to make sure that most of the American population are slaves that are either like at best indentured servants and at worst owned by other humans again. And then anybody else who thinks that they can survive is some kind of like ex communicated person who still existing on American soil will basically be either human biofuel or able to be picked up by these sub like I don't know what the term is, but like these almost like para military groups that are created like the KKK and whatnot as a consequence of people who want to get their PM behaviors out with some kind of like AM purpose.

But this is what I'm seeing and if you're one of these people who I'm describing in the next like two minutes, don't be afraid as to what's happening. The destruction of American government is at the end of the day, it's not meant for you. You're just supposed to be so emotionally riled up that you make a bad decision whether that's going out into the street and like literally getting yourself deleted by the federal government or it's saying something that's going to destroy your reputation and then you don't have access to community after this. But I want you to stay calm and to just stay regulating what you have access to right now and making sure that the connections you have access to are willing to support you if you have to go underground for months or even a couple of years.

I'm not trying to fearmonger with that, but it's going to make sense in a second. Now, what I'm seeing over the past 18 months is that women are losing access to humanity, disabled people have never had access to humanity and that's being exacerbated. LGBTQ people, especially transgenders are being dehumanized in legislation, just like women are actively and have been. And any marginalized person who we can't like directly dehumanize or like as a non-American, we're just going to attack them by blocking, highlighting them, have access to jumping up in the social class system or being able to elevate themselves beyond their current circumstances.

So if you're born in poverty, you're never going to make it out. It doesn't matter how hard you work. Somebody else is just going to get rich off all that hope and belief that you have in this system. And you will be somebody else's American dream.

Somebody's like 45th yacht. And that is related to the DEI situation, which is actually kind of sad because I've seen a handful of liberals speaking about the removal of DEI and how it's going to make employment fair again and the job market is just going to infinitely be better. No, no, this is this is what's actually going to happen though. And I'm glad that Trump is doing so much so quickly so we can really just start putting the pieces of this puzzle together so you can see your own fate right in front of your eyes before I get punished for it.

So, and I'm not making this up go look at that dude Nick Fuente is or whatever, he'd be saying shit like this all the time. I guess they think that it's just going to be white American men, they're AI girlfriends and then whatever women they can convince to join the Handmaid's T.L. Society of like the religious resurgence. And then they can replace the actual working class like marginalized people with robots to convenience themselves and the exploitation that they're doing on like a globalized scale.

But then on top while denying marginalized people, specifically black people, opportunities, we look like we aren't contributing to society, but they look like they're contributing because they're making all the money off exploiting us. And they can start calling this monkey and the N word and hanging us and all types of stuff because why are we just existing around them and their Aryan greatness. Why are we here like you guys are forgetting that it's not what are people going to do when we don't have jobs anymore. And we have to think about we aren't human and the only value that we even provided to this society was our labor or was our ability to like keep community and culture sustained.

If they can start programming that through robots, they're just going to use this as target practice. Everyone go ahead and check out that book or that story, the most dangerous game. I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen in the American streets. If there isn't some kind of purge or the people actually are dumb enough to do a civil war.

Because they still believe their broke neighbor is stealing their human rights and their other neighbor is stealing their money. And the person above them is not doing anything while they dance on top of our heads and piss on all of us. But that group of very insecure, patriarchal psychosis, bros, that thinks that they're going to save America and bring it back to this like bastard Roman greatness that they think it had achieved at some point. Mind you, let me burst that bubble.

The only reason why this country exists is not only because the decimation of the indigenous people who already existed here. But it was also because you had to use a whole entire new energy source, which was those slaves indigenous slaves and African slaves that you had here. You would have actually not been able to build this shit. Your political philosophy, your religion, none of it is there's no ingenuity there.

There's no greatness there. All the dark shit that you refuse to speak about, that's what brought this country to life. And all the other stuff is just sprinkles on top of a very, very sick black like rotten cake. But it's good bedtime stories to kids who also want to aspire to be the same like demonic villains that exist on the top of this society.

Back to the point, that's not going to be the world that you guys get. And I hope you guys realize that if we are slaves and go back to that type of shit, you are going to be one of us as well. Because you don't contribute any to any society where there's robots that can think better more efficiently than the average human being. And you aren't even close to, especially cognitively close to an average human being.

Go ahead and research what the literacy rate in America is. Oh, wait, did I say in this video that they destroyed the Department of Education already? Yeah, that was intentional. But who could be coming into this country?

What are these illegal immigrants that were afraid of taking our rights and living off our welfare? Oh, oh wait, I think I know who it's going to be. It's going to be the mind you, this isn't, it means to be racist. This is just me saying what the facts are.

They're pointing at Mexicans and not only Mexicans, but also pointing at dark skin and brown skin, refugees from these war-torn or third world countries from coming here. They want you to say that's the people stealing your opportunity. So we can import European high skills or at least a high potential European Indian and Asian talent into this country to work in our stem and our tech field because we've gotten so behind. And we literally can't fuck up this AI crypto race because that will send this illusion of America completely into a tailspin that it can never come back from.

But those people are going to be the new middle class and those will be not only the new middle class, but their standard of work will be so much more increased because they'll probably be running away from circumstances that they never want to go back to rather than the average American who's going to be coddled with AI convenience tools. That mean absolutely nothing and social games that mean absolutely nothing in a world where people are actually becoming slaves again. Mind you, that's not the only class of people. Trump said something about a gold card.

$5 million dollars for United States citizenship. Somebody told me that like, oh, that makes a lot of sense. That means we're going to have more investors in the United States. Before you get actual investors coming into a situation like that, you know what you're going to have criminals, not just criminals, crypto criminals that are coming here to launder money through a now very, very, very destabilized American country and not just crypto criminals that are coming from Dubai and enjoying the ruins of America.

But crypto criminals and rushing oligarchs get to come into America for only a measly $5 million dollars and they get to buy citizenship into America and now have more rights than you, a marginalized person who's probably going to lose your human rights in exchange for that. Because mind you, America is broke in our natural resource. Other than the American dream, mind you. Is slavery.

So forget this whole DEI bullshit conversation that you're having, bro. Just go ahead and call us if you want to because that's exactly what you mean by it and you're the reason why America is going to be an absolute shit show for the next 25 years and you have nobody to blame because it's in your hands now.
