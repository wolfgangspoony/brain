# Prediction

Okay, everybody, mark my words. I think that I know something that's going to happen. Now that we know that the United States has lost out on $13 billion worth of soybean exports because China does not want to buy soybeans from the United States because China does not want to play nice with a bully during a trade war. I think the United States realizes it's going to have to try and backstop that demand that those soybean farmers just lost out on.

So what are they going to do? Well, I think they're going to do is I think the United States government is going to create a whole bunch of advertising campaigns. Like I think they're literally going to astroturf advertising campaigns for these farmers and specifically for like finished foods companies like you know finished product, you know CPGs and whatnot. Well, those aren't CPGs, but you know what I'm saying.

And I think we're going to see a bunch of people start making like food influencing content and I think you're going to start seeing Jimbrose make like nutrition content about eating tofu and eating tempeh. And I think you're going to see a lot of restaurants like really lean into like meatless meat substitutes over the summer. I think it's all going to get astroturfed into the culture man. Like being a soy boy is going to like somehow become like a right wing thing guaranteed it.

You watch, you watch man.
