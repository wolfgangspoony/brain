# Snoop Dogg Story

Snoop dog daddy was taking him creeping when he was eight years old Old G came straight through the front gate Said here's your ragging your Pope Is that look down and smile? Said you'll be creeping for life Son this here is a bag of some blow And one little change your life And Snoop dog said, Hell am creeping, Bitch my sea walk is A side from here to the toe And you know LBCs what I'm rapping Them streets are deep in my soul And Lord you know I'm a pale Shit, daddy please Make me cry
