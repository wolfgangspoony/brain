# Rwanda's Approach to Homelessness

How does Rwanda care for their unhoused population? It's a very small country, but it's very heavily populated. So you'd think you'd have a lot of unhoused people lining the streets, like you do in a city here in the United States. You do see unhoused people, but it's not as common as you might think.

And one of the ways that they keep those numbers low is through house workers. A very common house setup is that you have your main house, and then you have like a courtyard space behind it, and then an outbuilding behind that. That courtyard space is where most of your life happens. That's where you cook, where you clean, where you spend your day.

And that outbuilding is where you store your food, your charcoal, all of the household goods. And it's very common for a Rwanda's person to have someone live in the outbuilding. That person is a house worker. They can cook or clean or wash or clothes, go to the market for you.

They have a lot of things that they can do around the household. And when we moved to our site in Rwanda, we were teaching there. We had a lot of people come to us and say, hey, if you need a house worker, here's some people who could do that for you. And we didn't have a house worker for a long time because we didn't fully understand the culture behind it.

And then I remember once having a conversation with one of our students, and he was like, why don't you have a servant? And we're like, as an American, and as a white person coming to Rwanda, and then having an unpaid laborer, having a servant, that's not okay. And they're like, why not? Why wouldn't that be okay?

And we're like, well, because it's a servant, and we're thinking like the optics of this like, class divide. But then we learned that people in our village had started to think that maybe we were a little bit rude. That we had extra space in our house, with no one living in it. And that's when we learned that it's actually kind of disrespectful to not have a house worker.

And I remember the day that it occurred to us that this is why we don't see unhoused people all over the place. It hit us that when we walk down the street, every single property has at least one house worker. There's at least one person there who cooks and cleans and takes care of the property in exchange for a place to sleep and food to eat. And then having this realization that this is how society has always functioned until we ruined it.

That you can have servants quarters built behind your house where the house workers live, but it's not degrading them. And it's not even really about using them for yourself or exploiting them. Because in the United States, we have a history of people having servants quarters on their property. But that was always some kind of exploitation.

And because of that, when you did see someone unhoused on the street, it was only ever because of a mental health reason. Because there are places for everyone. And it's not these institutionalized shelters where you're just taking all of the impoverished people and shoving them together. No, they're just in everyone's households.

But even for the people who do sleep on the street, there is food piled in to the structure of the town for them. Because in Rwanda, there are fruit trees all over the place. Sometimes on the street that there are guava trees or avocado trees, there's all kinds of food trees. And we observe that there are certain trees that people just leave the fruit.

And mostly that fruit is left for the most impoverished children. We would especially see this with guava trees that I'm not going to go and eat guava off of the tree that's on the side of the road. I'm going to go down the street and I'm going to buy guava from a farmer. Because I could afford it.

So if you can afford food, you buy food. But if you can't afford food, there's not a lot, but there is some for you. And there's this honor system. And it's a very strict honor system that it's bad culture to eat from those trees.

Because we had one of these trees that was right across the street from our house. Like if I went and I started eating from that guava tree, that's just me stealing from starving children. So yeah, I think the approach to the unhoused and the to the most vulnerable populations is to incorporate them into society there. Well, in the United States, often the practice is to try to get them out of sight, to push them into the margins of society.

So I guess in their society, it's just more shameful to be selfish than it is to be poor.
