# Wealth Distribution - 230 Million Splitting Scraps

There were 230 million people in America splitting $1.6 trillion in our economy. Today, more than 40 years later, there's 341 million people and $21.6 trillion in our M2 money supplies. So tell me why, tell me why, there's 20 times more money and only 50% more people. There's 50% more people and 2,000% more money.

Technically speaking, there's 10 times more money per person in America than there was in 40 years ago. So why does everyone feel 10 times broken? In 1971, we released ourselves from the Gold Standard. In 1976, we went into a crash in 1981.

We started Reaganomics 1989. We cemented in Reaganomics and Reaganomics cemented in one thing. The top get the money and they trickle it down to everybody else. But guess what?

Through the 90s, through the early 2000s, through the 2010s, guess what happened? The money went up top and it started to... Oh, wait, why would we trickle this down? Let's keep it up here.

Oh, let's invest over there. Oh, why would we buy that? Hey! We don't have to give them the money.

The money is in the top. The money is held by the investors. The asset holders. The big boys.

The big girls. Why? Something called the cantilean effect. The cantilean effect states that whenever money is added into our economy, by the way, he's a 18th century French economist.

We we he stated that when money is printed added into the economy, quantitative easing, a mint printing, whatever you want to do, the only two parties benefit. The people printing it and the people that have assets. The people at the top who get the money first before it's inflated and the people who have assets that are going to grow in value because there's more money in the economy. Guys, there is 10 times more money per head in America, but yet more Americans day by day feel broker than they've ever felt.

Feel like getting started is more impossible than it's ever been and statistically they're right because since 1981, the cost to get started in America has never superseded the median income made in America and 2023 and 24 were the first years that happened for the first time. Meaning the median... follow me on this. The median amount to get started in America, having a house, two kids, white pick offence, paying for food, gas, phone, health insurance.

1981, the median household income, you made enough to get it started in 23 and 24, those lines crossed. In fact, the cost to get started in America, having a mortgage, two kids to use cars, gas and insurance in those cars, I've got these numbers right here, not just reading off nothing. One bout of student debt in the house, power food, phone and health insurance. In 1981, if you were doing all of that, you were paying 2171 bucks a month.

In 1989, it was 2291 bucks a month. 1998, it was 2636 bucks per month. You know how much it is in 2024 for the same exact metrics? $7368.

That's $88,416 a year. You know what the median income in America? $70 grand. Sorry, $74 grand.

$74 grand. You're $14,000 behind if you're at the median level and most people getting started in America haven't even made it to the median level yet. So tell me how millions of Americans who have not gotten started plan to get started. Because many of them feel broker than ever, even though there's 10 times as much money available.

I'm looking at you DC.
