# Labubu and Capitalism

No, owning a single Labubu is not capitulating to capitalism or participating in overconsumption. Disliking something because it's popular is just as vapid and uninteresting as liking something just because it's popular. Do I now have to run every toy I buy through an ethics committee even though I've been collecting toys for two decades? This one is off limits?

No, Sabrina Carpenter isn't setting back feminism because she likes her hair to be lightly tugged on. It's actually not a sin for a woman to enjoy having sex with a man, even if it's not missionary with eye contact despite what the church and apparently what you guys say. Should we compare her to a chewed-up wad of bubblegum? Perhaps compare her anatomy to a wide hallway?

I mean, you guys are almost there. We need to get you to a pulpit or a frat house stack because you would just fit in so well. No, actually, Billy Eilish and Chapel Rowne aren't queer They're human beings going on a complex journey of discovering their identities. They're not one-off episodes on a sitcom.

Perhaps you should journey outside of your room every once in a while and actually talk to people in your community. And on that note, you actually don't get to tell me whether or not I get to participate in Pride because I was drawing titties on my Nintendo DS before you were even born. You don't get to turn people away from a club that you're not even old enough to buy a drink in. I think we've started to collectively confuse critical thinking with blind contrarianism and it is not going to lead to anything good.

Your constant need to justify your personal preferences with a strict code of morals is not social justice. You've just reinvented religion and I'm getting pretty tired of y'all knocking on my door and shoving pamphlets in my face. No solicitors, no thank you.
