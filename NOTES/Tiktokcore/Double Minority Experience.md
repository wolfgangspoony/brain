# Double Minority Experience

One of the great things about being a double minority is that you can sometimes shield yourself with your minority status from one group, from the critiques of the minority status from the other group. One of the most common critiques that you'll get from Chinese people if you're a Chinese person is you are a bad representation to the Chinese people at shiqqaanggai. I am a homosexual. I know that.

I am not expecting a stamp of approval from Xi Jinping. And sit on my face. Hundreds of men have sat on my face. Do you think that when a six or three Brazilian beefcake spreads his hairy cheeks in front of me?

I'm thinking to myself, wow, China's gonna be so proud of me. No! I want China to be disappointed. And gays.

Gays men are judgmental little. They don't know how to keep a comment to themselves. They'll come over and critique you on everything around your house. They'll be like, oh my god, is that lamp from Aikia?

Well, I don't know. Are your parents still together? Chris, why is this couch on this side of the room? Why don't you move this couch to the other side of the room?

How dare you? That is bad, fong shui. You want me to move the couch to the south side of my apartment while the wind is blowing east? You just wished my grandma 100 years of bad luck.

How could you? In order to reverse this curse now, you have to sit on my face.
