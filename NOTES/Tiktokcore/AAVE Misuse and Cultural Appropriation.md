# AAVE Misuse and Cultural Appropriation

And around 2022, I made a video called The Disrespect and Misuse of AV, right? Every five months or so, that video gets somewhat boost in views because it's still relevant to this day. I have never seen such a display of like... Okay.

In the first half of that video, I talk about how non-black people don't respect black people's boundaries when it comes to AV, with some terms like cis, umk, yin, yin is crazy. Like, Dianneau, like, Yonneau with yin means, right? If you're non-black and I call you out on using the term yin, like those white girls that were posted up with like the screen mass saying forced to be born to be a yin, that was crazy. If I call you out on that and your first response is, well, I didn't know, I didn't know that's what yin meant.

Why are you using words that you don't know the meaning of? Like, that's the problem. I hate this app for so many different reasons. One of those reasons being that this app has a high mind mentality.

Everyone is a sheep, right? It's not like that on Twitter, but whenever there is a new like phrase that belongs to AV, or something that a lot of the time black people made, people spam that shit in the comments and they make it corny. When non-black people found out what roasting was and started saying shit like this, it took years off my life. Seeing that this shit in comments to this day is it hurts to read because you don't talk like that.

Be yourself. Please, please be yourself. I cannot express enough how much I hate seeing this just everywhere. And I was going to a point where AV is getting used like ironically to like so they can be in on the joke, but like it just results in like non-black people mocking AV and reducing it down to Gen Z slang.

Like, it has grammatical rules. You cannot say I'm finna gonna go to the store. What? You cannot say that girl has a fat yacht.

That does not make sense. There are people still to this day in the big 2025 that still thinks that yacht means butt. In the second half of that video, I talk about how my personal problem with non-black people using AV was not the fact that they were non-black. It was the fact that you guys are using it incorrectly and still continue to use it incorrectly to this day.

If you read this sentence out loud and you pronounce this as ah, you're a loser and you sound stupid. My main problem with it is if you use AV specifically around black people or use AV to try to sound like cool, be yourself. I saw a video, I don't remember the creator, but they made a point dealing from RDC. He is not black, but he talks like, you know, like, like, marking them because he grew up around black people.

Like, if you didn't grow up talking like that and you try to now, it's gonna sound weird because that's not how you naturally talk. You guys spam AV and then later down the line when you hear a black person using AV, you're like, you still say that in 2025. Man, that died in 2024. You still sound that old shit.

No, I've been talking like this for years. There was a tweet the other day that they thought the term cooked like I'm cooked or this guy cooked here came from this picture, which no. Ah, side note, a lot of the misuse of AV on Twitter comes from Stan Twitter, specifically queer white men because they steal from black women and they want to sound like black women to be cool. Go to AV struggles, the Twitter page and just scroll.

It is hell. Final final notes, be yourself. Stop trying to be like everyone else. Just be yourself.

Stop forcing AV and stop using it incorrectly. Yeah.
