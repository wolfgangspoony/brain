# Gordon Ramsay Analysis

I've been watching a lot of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares recently, and I gotta say, it's like the perfect case study in the American small business tyrant. Like honestly, it could function as the curriculum in some kind of a Maoist reeducation facility or something. Like I think it was Matt Kirstman from Chopper Trap House who said that family-owned restaurants were like the dukes and barons of late-stage capitalist America or whatever, and honestly, like the people that run the restaurants on the show, it's like the ratio of their narcissism to their incompetence is like insane. Like these are the American petite bourgeois, and that has mostly been reflected in my experiences as a server.

Like I happen to be lucky enough to work at one of the relatively few good ones right now, but these are the people running everything on a regional level. Like honestly, I'm glad that most of these restaurants bailed as soon as the cameras turned up.
