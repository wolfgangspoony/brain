# Justin Scott Commentary

They built up Justin Scott in the Untake Hyle, Justin now be talking about how to get rid of them both or which one to get rid of and how fucking problematic each of them are. And it's crazy how y'all do shit like that, because what the fuck? It's always like either you great or you're terrible. It's almost like y'all don't pay attention to life.

Because if a broke month fucker tell you something about money, you just zone out. You don't realize that you should listen and pay attention to everything, that way you can get the real shit out of whatever you're looking at, and you can discern from the bullshit. Like a broke clock is right twice a day. But if you ain't paying attention, you're gonna miss them two times.

And you just gonna end up thinking a clock that's wrong is right all the time or a clock that's fucking right is wrong all the time. Like you're gonna be fucking up if you're not paying attention. Not granted, you shouldn't be looking at no individual person as perfect, because I'm gonna ask you, what show definition of perfect in the first play? What does perfect mean to you?

Because before we say nobody's perfect, we really need to know what the fuck do you think being perfect means first? Because I do personally feel like human beings have a perfect form, but they ain't got shit to do with physical shit. And I just feel like it's crazy to where some people is discussing these two men. But I'm gonna leave you out with this as it relates to our society.

A day can't full of children is going to self-destruct if there is no teacher in there. Even if the smartest child in the room stands up and takes control and all the children agree and already the follow that person. The daycare is going to burn down until a teacher walks in. And don't let that go over your head because it has nothing to do with intellect or intellectualism.

The problems in the world have everything to do with current level of conscious perception in the mass majority of human beings. And the only thing that can fix that is yoga and meditation. No amount of books can raise those glasses off your face and make you see more of what is here to be seen on the spectrum of all of this shit. Everything is energy and visible light makes up less than 1% of the energy on that spectrum.

So that means if anybody is supposed to be leading or talking or doing anything, even the people who are listening to the leaders and talkers. If nobody's perception goes beyond physicality, it will not go beyond survival and self-preservation. And if it doesn't go beyond survival and self-preservation, it doesn't matter how good the change looks, it doesn't matter what fire they're putting out. They are essentially putting out one fire and starting another one.

The difference is the fire they're starting, they can't see it, but the next generation will and that shit will fall on them and it'll be a burden of them to either do what that generation didn't do, which is what I just said or make the exact same mistake.
