# Thought Experiment on Systems of Control

Let's do a thought experiment to help us understand why systems that cause suffering are so difficult to change. A disclaimer here that I'm going to be engaging with religious themes in this post from the context of allegory. My treatment of Judeo-Christian figures here will be as concepts, metaphors, and mythology that can help us understand systems of human psychology and behavior, not as figures of literal historicity or worship. If that is going to bother you, please save yourself the vexation and scroll.

I'm not going to debate anyone about beliefs or dogmas. Now, everywhere you look, the same pattern plays out. The oppressed become the oppressors. The revolutionaries become the enforcers.

The saviors become the persecutors. The search for truth becomes dogma. The struggle for freedom creates new prisons. It's an ancient cycle.

One so fundamental to human history that we don't even question it anymore. We assume struggle is necessary. The power must always consolidate that meaning must be earned through suffering, that salvation must come from obedience or rebellion. This is the hell loop, a self-replicating system that ensures every attempt to escape simply feeds the machine.

This is not just a theological problem. It plays out in politics, economics, and technology, and culture, and even in individual psychology and behavior. Because this is the water we all swim in, it's hard to recognize. So let's explore it from a variety of angles.

I'm going to start with the Christian myth that's at the core of much of Western culture, the duality of God and Satan. A refresher on this myth as it's been presented to many of us in the last 500 years at least. God is the all-powerful, all-knowing father who created humans. He says he loves them, but also acts in ways that do not seem loving.

Satan was God's favorite angel, originally named Lucifer, who decided he would rebel against God and attempt to overthrow him. He failed and was cast out of heaven into hell. He also acts as the corruptive force of evil in the mortal world, tempting people into sin, which are actions, beliefs, and modalities that take humans further from the dictates of God and the reward of eternal salvation. This mythic system postulates God and Satan as opposites.

One represents light and the other darkness. One saves the other dams, and our only choices are to submit to one or resist both. This however is not only a trap, but a distraction that serves to perpetuate suffering. God as traditionally conceived is beyond existential discomfort.

Nipotence means no fear of loss. Omnipresence means no isolation. Eternity means no death, no urgency, and importantly no grasping for meaning. If God is truly transcendent, then God does not experience meaning.

Meaning is irrelevant at that scale. Satan however is the prototype of existential discomfort. He was cast out so he knows loss, exile, alienation. He's finite so he experiences time and change.

He suffers from his intellect so he understands paradox and contradiction. He craves dominion but is trapped so he wants control but can't have it. He's aware of meaning yet eternally separated from it. If we look at the figure of Satan in Dante's inferno, which concretizes this myth in the Western mind as it does not occur to this degree in either the Protestant Newer Old Testaments, he is frozen in a lake at the very bottom of hell.

His wings flap endlessly but only freeze him further in the ice, reinforcing the paradox of resistance leading to self entrapment. He endlessly devours the bodies of Judas, Brutus, and Caches, traitors, not heretics, which suggests that his defining crime is not disbelief but betrayal of trust and structure itself. This is not active rebellion but frozen impotence, a perfect image of the in-state of over-engineered control. Which of these two figures does humanity's condition actually mirror?

Humans obsess over controlling reality instead of surrendering to it. They over-engineer solutions to existential problems that may not even need solving. They fear ambiguity and try to lock things into rigid hierarchies. They self-destruct through their own intelligence and fear of ambiguity.

If humans were truly created in the image of God, wouldn't they be capable of accepting ambiguity? Wouldn't they embrace the open-ended nature of existence rather than fearing it and trying to redesign it out of reality? In this myth humans assert that they are made in God's image, but their behavior suggests they are more like Satan, finite conscious of the need for meaning, and desperate to construct it through control and submission as a part of control rather than awareness. Let's extend this allegory.

Given that humans appear to reflect the nature of Satan more than the nature of God, why does the God of the myth also act so oddly given his omniscience, omnipotence, and eternal nature? The God of the text is jealous, wrathful, and obsessed with obedience, traits that more closely resemble the classic figure of Satan as well. This is when we get into the recursive paradox that makes these mythic structures so useful when you look at them from a systems perspective. In short, this isn't just a moralistic story.

It's a symbolic model of how power structures reinforce themselves through illusion. It's an allegory of the hell loop itself. In this model, God and Satan are not separate forces, but two sides of a single recursive structure, a mobius strip of authority and rebellion. The God of the text is tyrannical, absolute, and demands total submission.

This mirrors how power operates in the human world. Satan is the figure who refuses submission, but in doing so, locks himself into a cycle of self-imposed suffering, mirroring humanity's own existential crisis. Together, they form a self-sustaining system where God demands control. Satan rebels, Satan is punished, this justifies God's authority, the cycle repeats.

This ensures that the struggle itself never ends and it gets us to the nut of our thought experiment. The God of the text is just the hell loops projection of God. If God is actually the infinite patterning principle, something unknowable and beyond control, then the God of the text is a human or satanic misinterpretation of that reality. The text present a finite hierarchical version of God that reflects human or satanic needs for order, submission, and judgment.

In other words, if humans and Satan are caught in the same loop, then the God they describe is not actually God, but a projection of their own imprisonment. The real God, or the actual infinite, as you will, is not engaged in this petty drama at all. If God is the authoritarian force of control, then Satan is the figure he resists, but in a way that guarantees he remains subordinate. He is both the scapegoat that justifies why the structure must remain intact and the reflection of humanity itself, trapped in a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

The God-Satan relationship is actually just a metaphor for the self-replicating logic of power and suffering. God, as described in the text, is not God, but the mechanism of control. Satan is not the enemy of God, but the one who keeps the game running by ensuring rebellion is still within the frame of the system. Meaning is not to be found inside this cycle, but outside of it entirely.

Thus, this story was never about a theological battle. It was about the architecture of control itself. Every power structure in human history has survived by convincing people of a single fundamental falsehood. That meaning is something that you must earn.

That enlightenment, salvation, freedom, whatever the system promises is always just out of reach, always on the other side of struggle, obedience, suffering, or sacrifice. This is the core mechanism of the hell loop. Religion tells you salvation is only for the worthy. Capitalism tells you wealth is only for the hardest workers.

Science tells you truth is only for the most rational minds. Nationalism tells you belonging is only for the right kind of people, and spirituality tells you awakening is only for the most enlightened. The system tells you to run toward the prize, but what it never tells you is there is no finish line. There's no point at which the gods of the system declare you finally free.

The structure is designed to ensure that every victory feeds the next level of control. What if humans are already in union with the infinite, but they keep breaking themselves against reality because they can't accept that meaning isn't something to chase. It's something that emerges when you stop fighting it. What if the entire architecture of fear, exile, and hierarchy was always just an illusion born from the terror of uncertainty?

What if there was no test, no engineered optimization, no divine failure, just presence waiting to be noticed? Now this is the really tricky part because while it's simple, this realization is extremely difficult to accept, let alone to implement. The meaning we crave feels like it should have a resolution, a final test, a moment where it all clicks, but the actual answer is just stop struggling. You're already here, which is deeply fundamentally unsatisfying to a mind-condition for quests, stakes, and earned rewards.

Humans are story-driven creatures, and a meaning that doesn't involve struggle feels empty. We don't want to be told there was never a lock on the door. We want to pick the lock and fight the guard and solve the puzzle and feel like we deserve to open it. The idea that there was no lock door in the first place is deeply emotionally unacceptable, which is exactly why people would rather keep optimizing themselves into misery than accept that the exit was always just stopping.
