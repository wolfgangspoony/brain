# Art Studio Tour - Remaining Works

We are in my studio standing in front of the remaining pieces of my PIS jars. Their government name is Compulsive Self-Surveillance. So this piece was 96 jars of my own urine collected, timed, and dated. Over the course of four months, I collected my own pee and signed and dated it every single time.

It was supposed to be my Honours thesis project at NYU, and they ended up censoring the work, and it caused a huge uproar. Essentially, I was trying to exert my conscious willpower over the subconscious functions of the body. So I was trying to predict and force my body to create certain pigments. So I'd say, I want to make green pee.

How can I make green pee? What I would do is I would take 12 vitamin B12 pills, pee in the jar, it'd be neon yellow. I would leave the jar open so the air could contaminate it a little bit, and it would oxidize, and turn into a beautiful, beautiful, deep green. So I ended up with brown, red, orange, yellow, white, when I had a yeast infection.

Clear, all just a beautiful range of colors, and it turned into sort of a beautiful, like, mosaic. Almost like I was thinking of stained glass when I was making it. And so it was all about the body, and what my mind can force my body to do. So it was definitely more of a conceptual piece than, every time I got my period, I would stop for the week, so there was no blood included, but there was red blood.

And I did that, but wait, not red blood. Red urine, and I did that by eating, like, all beats, and shit was crazy. There were two days where I didn't drink any water. I just drank whiskey, and I created a beautiful, rusty orange, and I still had to go to school and work like that.

So I was super drunk the entire time, but because it was art school, I would just tell my professors, hey, I'm doing this performance. I am going to actively be drinking during this class, and I am drunk. And they're like, OK, that's cool, but don't hurt yourself. It only takes one day to harm your liver.

And so that's when I started realizing that I kind of had to think long-term in terms of my body and how I was preserving it, because I'm always one to put my body on the line for my work. I think it's the noblest, most honorable way to make work is to devote your body. And this is some paper I made, but we'll talk about that later.
