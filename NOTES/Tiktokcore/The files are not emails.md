# The Files Are Not Emails

The files are not emails. Alright, you think these dorks give a flying fuck in a rolling doughnut about emails? No, you're not going to have the sophisticated blackmail ring based on emails. Alright, the files are video.

Yes, videos. Alright, and this is the thing is that we've had the technology to manipulate video and to manipulate email through Photoshop for decades. And if you think that the technology that we have access to is the technology that the overlords have access to, you're incorrect. The overlords have access to technology that we do not because it has not been commercialized yet.

Alright, they fund the development of the tech, they have access to tech that we don't even know exist yet. So, here's the thing is we have to look at why are we so obsessed culturally, psychologically, with needing evidence rather than believing people's stories. Why can't we trust our intuition and believe people's stories that are telling us something? This is where Renee DeCarte comes in.

The father of scientific thought, the father, okay, who brought into culture the idea of seeing as believing a materialist worldview. So everyone's like, oh, I have to see to believe, I have to see to believe this is the basis of our education is around materialism. The biggest threat to the status quo is a metaphysical understanding of the universe, which is what Dundanana, most spiritual people have, a metaphysical understanding, quantum physics, exploring the metaphysical understanding of the universe, right? But if we're rooted in this Cartesian materialist worldview then we're going to be like, well, I need the evidence, I can't just trust my instincts, I can't just trust my gut.

Because to trust your intuition, that's feminine, that's a feminine thing. That is why misogyny is also so much a part of this, right? It's because to trust your intuition, that's feminine, that's a feminine thing. Oh, also how about religion calling you a witch if you trust your intuition.

Not very safe to be like, why just like feeling in my body? This is why disembodiment is so crucial. Because if we're not in our bodies and we're not feeling our intuition, why do you think they're poisoning us all the time? With the food and the chemicals in the sky.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, they want us to like, the pharmaceuticals and the medical industrial complex. Sure, but they also want to destroy our relationship to our endocrine system, which is our intuition, which is our gut feelings. Yeah, so this is why it is so important to be in our bodies and to have a relationship with your body and in your intuition. Because it is only then that you can listen to a victim's story and feel in your body, that is true.

I don't need to go through the garbledy goop, kabubidi doop of what's happening with this rolled out marketing ploy of these files, which are of course starting with email so you can picture it. Okay, cool, the trauma of picturing it. That's what we're all feeling collectively now, the visualizing and then they'll be like, oh, let's put, here you go with the videos. And then we go through the cultural gaslighting, and they will say, real, is it the AI?

What's happening? Dada da da, instead of just connecting to our guts in our intuition and just knowing, knowing the level of corruption, knowing the level of violence, knowing that this happened to people because people have been telling us the whole time. Okay, so this is why it's really important to be in your body and this is why they're always trying to disembodiate. So spend your day torquing against your knee.

I hope that was helpful.
