# Long-Form Political Analysis

I have a theory as to why millennials are just different from every other generation that's currently alive right now. And I'm not saying millennials are better. I'm just saying that there's something uniquely different about this generation. By the way, this is gonna be a long one so.

So there's this book called Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. I highly recommend if you haven't read it. It's about this dude who talks to a talking gorilla. Hear me out, okay?

In one of their conversations, the gorilla explains to the guy that since the beginning of human history, there have basically been three moments that have defined human progress. There are three points in the entire human timeline that mark a clear before and after in human history. The first point is the invention of agriculture. And the gorilla actually refers to this as humanity's original sin, but that's a topic for another video.

For about two million years, right? Since the onset of homo sapiens, sapiens, older to the beginning of agriculture, humans lived as hunter-gatherers. And during that time, life was pretty much the same. Your life, your parents life, your grandparents life, your great-great-grandparents life, going all the way back for two million years.

Things are basically the same. And then agriculture comes around and then the way of life for humans fundamentally changes. We go from a hunter-gatherer society to the beginning of what we understand as civilization. And then from there, for about 12,000 years, broadly speaking, life kind of becomes the same again.

This massive change happens and then things just kind of plateau again. Different civilizations come and go, but for the most part, for 12,000 years, human life is just kind of the same. All the way until the industrial revolution. And then within a single person's lifetime, a single generation, the entire fabric of humanity has changed again.

The industrial revolution happens and the technology that comes out of it fundamentally changes the course of human history. Like imagine growing up in the industrial revolution and you're there to witness the invention of this demagin. The invention of electricity, if you were born a couple generations before this, your life would have been pretty much the same as hundreds of generations before you. And if you were born just a couple generations after the industrial revolution, your life would be pretty similar to the several generations after you.

But if you were born in the industrial revolution, you saw a literal shift in the collective human experience. Like the world that you were born into didn't have light bulbs. You saw a day, there are light bulbs on every street corner inside every household. You don't really relate to your grandparents or even their parents.

And your kids will never understand the world that you grew up in as a kid. Anyways, the first of these major inflection points is the agricultural revolution. The second is the industrial revolution. And the third is the information revolution.

The invention and the proliferation of the internet is the third moment in human history where you can clearly mark A before and after. As we know it really only started to take off in the late 90s. So if you're born in the 80s or early 90s, meaning if you're a millennial, you have the distinct experience of living life before, during and after this pivotal moment in human history. But you also grew up with this moment.

You were a part of making and shaping this moment. And once that infrastructure was established, every generation that was born after was born into the after. Like if you don't remember life before Wi-Fi or life before dial up, you are firmly in this next chapter of humanity, this post-internet post-information revolution generation. But just like the people who grew up during the industrial revolution or the agricultural revolution, if you grew up during the information revolution, your life spans across these two distinct eras of human existence.

And surely that must mean something, right? I don't know if that makes millennials more optimistic and hopeful or just constantly, existentially lost. Obviously this is going to manifest in individuals differently, but I do think that this is a uniquely defining condition of being a millennial. And as a millennial, it's not always easy to relate to the generation before or after.

And I think this discrepancy is more than just like the typical chronocentric attitude that we have scrapped to most generations. Also the elephant in the room is that the time period between the first humans and the sort of agriculture was two million years. And then the time between that and the start of the industrial revolution was only twelve thousand years. And then it was only like two hundred some years later that the internet was invented.

Two million, twelve thousand and two hundred. That's an extremely exponential curve. If you're watching this right now, you'll probably be around to witness that fourth event in human history. In fact, some people are already saying that AI is that next big before and after moment.

I don't know, that's above me. But that's my half-bake theory as to why as a millennial, millennials are special.
