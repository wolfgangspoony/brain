# Craftsmanship vs Shortcuts

I've already explained how plastic surgery is basically the powdered french wig of our aristocracy. The difference is that instead of relying on crossmanship or unattainable materials like gems and precious metals, they're relying on biological augmentation. And it's interesting because once you get to a certain level of plastic surgery, you enter uncanny valley where our normal human brains can no longer recognize you as truly human. This is done deliberately and in the exact same way that a french peasant could steal a wig and run around as an aristocrat.

Some women can still afford a couple hundred dollars to get lip injections and maybe breast implants and things like that. But you will never be able to afford the stem cell therapies that poor people provide the stem cells for. When they circumcise your child, they use his penis for facials. What is it?

It is extraction, a piece of skin that came from a young person far far away and they somehow figured out how to extract. It's four skin from a Korean baby. When they take your placenta after birth, they use those stem cells for treatments and therapies to live longer and heal wounds faster. You can't afford them.

That's the point. Now when nurling launches and these people figure out a way to allegedly make their brains faster, improve their processing power, give them the ability to speak multiple languages with ease, etc. You're going to feel less than because you will be less than a fucking cyborg. But remember, that actually doesn't make you less beautiful than your grandmothers, grandmothers, grandmothers, grandmothers, grandmother whose bones live unrefined in your perfect face.

As we continue trying to adjust our definitions of what it means to be human and what it means to be intelligent and what it means to be beautiful, I want you to merely entertain the possibility that the greatest rebellion you can offer is the desire to be your own and to be a creature of this earth, not sustaining itself off the stem cells of other human beings and the precious metals that exist in the underbelly of our planet that we were probably never really meant to find.
