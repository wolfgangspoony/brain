# Perception and Reality

If you think it's a chair or is your hand, if you don't think it's a chair, I want to look around at each other to each mentally. Like, oh, you have people looking at you. Okay? Okay, so not everyone is raising their hand, which is interesting, because chair is like a stupid, simple word.

All right, we're just going to go quick. Chair and not chair. Beautiful. Yeah, you can say it a lot.

That works. Chair and not chair. Chair. Chair and not chair.

Chair. Not chair. No chair. Not chair.

Not chair. Okay, so it's like a 4060 split. That's fascinating to me. Again, chair isn't where you learn in Tinder.

Chair and not chair. Chair. Not chair. Isn't this kind of weird, though?

Isn't it interesting that this simple word that we all use, like most it is, is actually very contentious? This is an art installation at the Broad. Not chair. On my side of it, you're not allowed to sit on it.

So unlike a horse, it's not a chair. This was one of the first ones I showed you. Just, I'm just curious if this one changes anything. This is an AI generation image.

Is that for any of you, change it from chair to not chair? Not chair. That makes it not chair? Yeah.

Now here's my question about that. I haven't shown you any real chairs. They've all been pictures. Hey.

I need a mirror. I need a mirror. Right. The reason that matters is because I think deep down, a lot of us are this really aware of the fact it is a weird little conscious being, as a self-contained ego and an eye, a conscious experience.

There's like a way in which we're fundamentally doomed to always be alone, right? And so we play the game of language as a proxy for direct telepathy, basically. And I think part of the problem that people face when they're looking at a thing like it's a hot dog or we're talking about what is a chair or maybe we're talking about what is a woman. Is that when we encounter these edge cases that don't fit neatly into the game system that we've been playing or were forced to look closer at the game system and recognize that like it's not actually as comprehensive as we thought it was.

While that calls into doubt, our ability to actually ever connect. If language is the mechanism by which we connect and communicate our deepest truths to one another, and by which we understand and are understood, confronting the fact that language is imperfect and messing. In precise, unavoidably so, it is distressing.
