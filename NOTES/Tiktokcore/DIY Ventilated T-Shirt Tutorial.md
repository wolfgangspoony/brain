# DIY Ventilated T-Shirt Tutorial

Last year I added these perforations to my t-shirt to increase air flow and ventilation. Then I tried out this design here which is a little bit more structured. Now I'm back at it again to implement a design that's been rolling around in my head for some time now. I cut the shape I wanted into tracing paper and then mirrored it so it's equal on both sides.

Following the edge of the chalk line, I decided to make this grid line using the width of a ruler to help me place the perforations evenly. Just started using this chalk tool which is awesome. It's filled with powdered chalk and as you run this spiky little wheel along the fabric, it creates the chalk line by dispensing the powdered chalk. This is a top discovery in 2025.

Now I take my trusty scissors which are fabric specific and sharp. I start snipping out tiny pieces of fabric in the center of the line between where the two lines cross. This part really didn't take me very long to do maybe 20 minutes and you just kind of put some music on and get into a bit of a flow state. You can sure to keep the cut small like a quarter inch.

Okay so let's see how this turned out. I wanted to keep the focus of the ventilation to the sides of the body and under arm for optimal air flow and heat dissipation. The previous shirt's I was pretty much just freestyling it. By mapping out the design I wanted this time I was able to create smooth and even lines that are pretty linear.

I know it's the dead of winter in many places in the world right now but summer 2026 it's common so give this a try.
