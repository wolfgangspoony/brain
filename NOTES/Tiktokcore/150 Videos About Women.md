# 150 Videos About Women

So I saw 150 videos today about women complaining that they don't get approached in public settings anymore This is my dad by the way you're being introduced to him anyway So I've decided that I in 2026 will approach all of the women all of the time on behalf of the men who are too afraid to and I will be doing it with this Cowell on like this so I will be wearing the cowl of you know the torture man from the island perpetual tickling if you get that reference We should get married by the way and and I'll just be sauntering up to them like this kind of wiggly like a little back and forth kind of thing and Regardless if they are alone or with friends I just get come up to about eye level distance with them right and I take off my ring off my finger And I hold it in front of them and I go here you can have this and I've already got boom there. Oh wow magic At that point I slowly back away and I say I've already got your phone number and Then I leave now This is a win-win situation for the women because they have just been approached by a man and it seems like all these women don't really care About the feelings of the men who approached them They just want to be approached so they can have the opportunity to reject someone and elevate their own standing in Like society based on the fact they're attractive enough to be approached But still powerful enough to reject whoever they want and guys want the exact same thing where they want to be seen as an option And conversate as and be treated as human beings And so now imagine a guy any guy comes up and talks to the girl. I just did that too a conversation starts Based on my weirdness were both of them feel seen in human and treat each other as as normal people I Feel like for me being willing to take the illness regard everyone wins so if you happen to see me at a local bar and And and approaching women it trust me. I'm right where I not only want to be where I need to be to save the rest of y'all From living your lives alone forever All right, thanks for watching
