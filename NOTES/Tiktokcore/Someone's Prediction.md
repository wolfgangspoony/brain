# Someone's Prediction

I've been thinking a lot about what William Schattener said about his trip to space. He said that he thought it was going to be a cathartic experience, kind of like a one with the universe type of thing, and instead he found that it filled him with the deepest sense of grief that he ever experienced. He describes being surrounded by the vicious coldness of space, and looking down at our tiny planet and just being consumed with this deep profound sadness at knowing that we are destroying our only home. Like he said, it felt like a funeral, and it's apparently not uncommon to have this particular experience when you're up in space.

It is known as the overview effect, and I just think it is absolutely crazy that we sent a man that whose name is basically synonymous with space travel. We sent him up to space for realsies, and he came back down, and you know what he said about it? He said, damn, that was fucking sad. That was sad, and that was scary, and I didn't like being up there actually.

Actually, actually, actually, space is not very nice. It's not very pleasant, okay? We should probably care a little bit more about what we're doing to Earth, because that's our home. That's what we need to be focused on, not up there, yeah.

So what did we do? Just a little bit of things, so what did we do? We sent Katie Perry into space. We sent Katie Perry into space with her little butterfly post it now, and her daisies.

I mean, do you think she experienced the overview effect when she was up there? Probably not. She's probably too busy promoting her upcoming tour. She's too busy being a girl last night.

I don't think that we should be sending celebrities into space, period. But if we do, the one positive thing that could come out of that absolute waste of time and money and resources would be for them to use that publicity to promote fighting climate change, to raise awareness and funds to help save the literal only home that we have instead of glorifying the man just stay, the man just stay out of space. It's not majestic. It's fucking scary.

Okay, it's fucking scary. We have too much shit going on down here, fuck space.
