# Nerds Listen Up - Tech Critique

All right, listen up nerds. Would you like to know exactly why synthetic fertilizers are bad and Why I still use them for certain things anyways because they're not really bad. Okay, so ammonium is Identical in nature whether it's organic or synthetic We don't even necessarily know what we mean by organic organic is such a loose I'm beginning to learn that the word organic is such a loose term and requires way more nuanced than the whip with them Then we give it for example. I feed my photosynthetic bacteria ammonium chloride because it's a powerful nitrogen source And I can get massive populations of microbes, but Keith.

I thought synthetic fertilizers actually kill microbes They don't microbes love synthetic fertilizers In fact, they love it too much. You see when you add something like ammonium chloride to the soil You get a massive boom in microbial populations But you guys know composting right you need a carbon to nitrogen ratio Well for every one unit of nitrogen you have as fuel You must have like 20 plus units of carbon to balance out that ratio So when you get a massive boom in bacteria from the ammonium chloride as a synthetic fertilizer all those bacteria that are partying and a dark basement jacked upon red bull have to consume have to consume the humus the organic compounds the humic the the humic precursor molecules and dead plant roots The glomule in that the mushrooms make to bind the soil together all the bile films that the bacteria produce to bind the soil together All that gets consumed in the frenzy that is the microbial boom From the spike and nitrogen does that make sense? So nitrogen in fact doesn't kill microbes it causes them to explode so catastrophically that they consume their own home on top of that Plants that get fed these synthetic fertilizers No longer feed the soil with their plant roots because that's what happens a plant releases Exudates organic acids sugars don't quote me on this But something like 70 plus percent of the sugars a plant makes in its leaves It pumps those sugars out in different forms into the soil to attract bacteria to attract fungi Depending upon what the plant needs at any given time of its life It will produce very specific organic compounds sugars to attract microbes that benefit the plant in certain ways The synthetics over a long period of time you start to cut off that relationship the plant says I'm getting free food Why am I going to produce root exudates? So it's a double whammy first you kill off the microbes because there's so many of them they eat their own homes and Then the plants stop feeding sugars into the soil and of course microbes eat sugar And so this there isn't so they the the plants the microbes have no food The plants aren't putting food into the soil anymore because they're getting the food straight from the synthetic fertilizer so Guess that sounds like synthetic equals bad, but no not necessarily It's the context in which we use them for example to fertilize one acre of land with my photosynthetic bacteria It would require loosely on the on the low end a gallon of concentrated a gallon of concentrate Which requires about less than one about 1% of a gram what let about 1% of a gram of ammonium chloride is what I feed To have one a one gallon batch of photosynthetic non sulfur bacteria I then apply that bacteria to the one acre of land and That bacteria inoculates the land and it actually It actually converts nitrogen from the air to feed it to the plant and it creates nitrogen in the soil because Plant nerds this is what happens in the soil ammonium is created by plants themselves ammonium chloride is not like a fake thing that doesn't exist naturally in the world But it's considered a synthetic fertilizer you ammonium comes from the decomposition of Proteins proteins break down into amino acids amino acids break down into ammonia ammonia Binds with protons in the soil keep up plant nerds ammonia binds to proc binds with protons in the soil to create ammonium Right that ammonium further and then that ammonium gets absorbed by the plants if you're watering your plants with chlorinated tap water the Chlorides from your water mix with the ammonium and turn into ammonium chloride the same non organic ingredient That's a synthetic non organic.

That's like the evil ingredient. You can't use that. It's synthetic is the same exact Compound created in the soil when you water your soil with chlorinated water The chloride binds to the ammonium and it creates ammonium chloride Mind you chloride is a natural essential plant mineral and small doses You're starting to see the holistic perspective the idea is whatever you are using at the end of the day Are you producing More diversity in the soil? Are you are you contributing to more organic growth and more organic accumulation in the soil about what you're doing?

Or are you degrading the soil? Are you using 100 to 200 pounds of pure ammonium chloride to fertilize an acre of land or are you using less? You're or are you using 1% of 1 gram of ammonium chloride to grow a dominant bacterial strain that you then Distribute across that same one acre of land They both use the same product one uses almost an infinitismally less amount and Gross bacteria sustainably and the other one kills the microbes Disassociates the plant relationship with the soil the ammonium turns into nitrates by bacteria Which is super water soluble so when it rains all that shit washes out of the soil again the ammonium in our case the Synthetic evil fertilizer in our case. It's not bad.

It's not good. It's what's its role in the soil? Are you supporting life or are you destroying it? Because at the end of the day ammonium is ammonium Whether it's produced in a lab reacting hydrogen chloride The chloride chloride acid mixed with I don't even remember what it is.

Monium It's ammonia gas mixed mixed with hydrochloric acid, right? That's how you make ammonia in the lab or If you're making ammonia and the soil by breaking down proteins and peptides and amino acids ammonia is ammonia The plant does the same thing with it one is not evil and it's the real it's a context while this was a long video plant nerds Unite
