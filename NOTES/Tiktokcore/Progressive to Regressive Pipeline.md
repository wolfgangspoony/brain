# Progressive to Regressive Pipeline

The way y'all went from being so progressive just five years ago. That's because they were never progressive in the first place. A lot of zoomer progressives never actually internalized the values of progressivism. What they did is co-opt the behaviors and language of progressivism in order to adhere to an aesthetic.

That aesthetic being what they perceived as counterculturalism. And the comparison to boomers makes more sense when you remember that boomers were hippies. Boomers were the anti-establishment. They were anti-war.

They were anti-the-man. And then they voted for Reagan. Now is it insane that conservatives have managed to position their party as the one of counterculturalism? Yes, yes it is insane.

And to understand how they did this all you need to do is look at Fox News. They are constantly saying that they're the ones who are being suppressed. That they are the ones who are under attack. Even though they are the biggest news network out there.

See what they did was appeal to a group of people who felt like they were under attack but in reality still held the majority of institutional power. And this is also something that the Democrats and the liberals and the left is going to have to reckon with in the next however long we still are able to have you know voting.
